The eye works on ray tracing (photons hitting the retina) so it should work.\n\nBiggest issue I had was the announcement that the cards were fabbed on Samsung 8nm ""Nvidia custom node"".\n\nI don\'t really like this, that\'s a really old ass node. Samsung 8nm is really just Samsung 10nm with a new coat of paint. About 15% logic density over 10 nm, with maybe 5-8% performance gain.\n\nIt\'s hard to compare logic nodes between manufacturers, performance is very hard, but for transistor density this chart is good,\n\n[https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm\\_vs\\_10nm\\_vs\\_12nm\\_vs\\_14nm\\_Transistor\\_Densities](https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm_vs_10nm_vs_12nm_vs_14nm_Transistor_Densities)\n\nRTX 2000-series was on TSMC 12 nm with 34 million transistors per mm\\^2, Samsung 8nm is 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. It\'s a nice 80% density gain, but it\'s like really fucking old stuff. Smartphone were getting fabbed on TSMC 10 nm (comparable to Samsung 8nm), in 2017 with the Snapdragon 845 (thing that goes in all flagship android phones).\n\nIn 2018 Snapdragon 855 was on 7nm.\n\nIn 2019 Snapdragon 865 was on ""advanced 7nm"" N7P, about a 15% performance gain.\n\nIn 2020 Apple will launch the next iPhone on TSMC’s 5nm EUV in a couple weeks.\n\nTSMC 5nm has a transistor density of 171.3 MTr /mm\\^2, destroying Samsung 8nm @ 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. Being around 2.8x more dense and \\~140% more performance per watt.\n\nNvidia seems to be on lukewarm terms with TSMC, while TSMC\'s new best friend is AMD. After lawmakers banned Huawei from using TSMC, AMD quickly gobbled up all their reserved 5nm wafers. AMD is going hard pushing newer nodes, of course larger dies like GPUs do kinda need to be on older more mature nodes. Just so they can fab such huge dies without defects and get good yields. AMD also has CPUs, which are much smaller and can handle higher defect rates. AMD is pushing 5nm CPUs in 2021, probably GPUs soon to follow. While Nvidia seems to be trying to nickle and dime Samsung getting good prices on their refreshed 10nm node.\n\nPros I think is that Samsung has a lot of capacity, they\'ve really fallen behind TSMC lately, and they kinda suck. But obviously Nvidia can still deliver strong performance gains and will be able to pump out a lot of GPUs with all that capacity available at Samsung. Leaving all that performance on the table also gives them a really easy next generation. All they would need to do is move the same GPU to TSMC 7nm EUV (which they really just could have fabbed on today), and they would have an almost free 2x boost in performance over Ampere.\n\nAlthough...maybe none of this really matters. Their data center work-horse Nvidia A100 is of course on TSMC 7nm, and that\'s where they make all the real money anyways. Gamers not clogging up capacity on TSMC 7nm so the people who pay the real money can get all the A100s they want is a good thing.\n\nNvidia has also been really successful in selling dedicated AI research hardware to gamers. The AI people are very happy, because they\'re getting everything they want, 24GB on 3090, 40GB on A100, vastly improved tensor units, hardware sparsity optimization, TF32. They\'re really happy about Ampere. Gamers get sold this as DLSS, RTX voice, NVIDIA Broadcast. I don\'t think they really realize the tensor cores will be sitting idle over 90% of the time in games, and they\'re really just for training and running neural networks. DLSS is really impressive though, the way AI lets you cast fewer rays and fill in the blanks with a neural network is very clever and does vastly improve picture quality.

Top holdings are:\n\nAAPL (Apple) - 7%\n\nMSFT (Microsoft) - 5.74%\n\nAMZN (Amazon) - 4.86%\n\nFB (Facebook)  - 2.4%\n\nGOOGL/GOOG - 3.3%\n\nBRK/B (Berkshire Hathaway) - 1.5%\n\nJNJ (Johnson &amp; Johnson( - 1.38%\n\nV (Visa) - 1.22%\n\nPG (Proctor &amp; Gamble) - 1.21%\n\nQQQ is a great ETF. It is likely to outperform VOO/S&amp;P 500 as long as tech continues to outperform the market. That said, there is a lot of crossover between QQQ and VOO.  The top holdings of QQQ include:\n\nAAPL - 14%\n\nAMZN - 11%\n\nMSFT - 11%\n\nFB - 4.5%\n\nGOOGL/GOOG - 7.1%\n\nTSLA - 3.3%\n\nNVDA - 2.6%\n\nSo, you can see that if you invest in both VOO and QQQ your top 5 holdings are the same, just different percentages. That\'s a fair bit of duplication. There is nothing wrong with doing that as long as you believe in those companies.  Just be aware of what you are doing and why. In fact, if you REALLY believed in some of those companies and wanted to INCREASE your holdings in one or two of those, you could ""enhance"" your holdings by putting some in an ETF that has one or two of those as an even larger percentage of its portfolio. For example, if you like Amazon FDIS is an ETF with 33% Amazon, followed by Tesla (7.4%), Home Depot (7%) and McDonald\'s (3.8%). Or you could invest in XLY which is 24% Amazon, 12% Home Depot, 6.5% McDonald\'s, 5.7% Nike and 4.5% Lowe\'s.  You can do the same with Apple (XLK is 25% Apple, VGT is 23% Apple, FTEC is 22.7% Apple, etc).\n\nNow, I\'m not RECOMMENDING enhancing your portfolio in this manner, I\'m merely demonstrating that you can really customize your portfolio with ETFs by duplicating your efforts in some companies to get exactly what you want without buying shares in individual companies (if that\'s what you want to do).\n\nPersonally, for new investors, I like the idea of investing into one broad market ETF (like VOO, for example) and then investing in a few sector ETFs.  You mention SOXX as one. That one specializes in semiconductors.  It\'s top holdings are QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%) AVGO (8.3%) TXN (7.9%), INTC, 5.3%, TSM (5.2%), AMD (5%). These are all solid companies. Keep in mind that if you pick VOO or QQQ as your broad market ETF, you are strong in the tech sector already and this is going to tilt your portfolio even more in the tech sector. Again, nothing wrong with that; just be aware of that.  (SMH is in most of the same companies, but different percentages). Both are highly rated ETFs.\n\nYou mentioned ICLN. I really like this ETF. I think clean/renewable energy is a sector that is only going to get stronger over the next 10 years .... well, really into the foreseeable future. It\'s been on a run the past 2 years and I think that will continue.  I\'m very bullish on this ETF and I own quite a few shares in it.  (About 200 or so). A couple of other ETFs in this sector that you should check into are: QCLN, TAN and PBW.  Look at their holdings and their history and decide which one or ones you want to invest in. They are all good.\n\nFinally, you mentioned ARKK.  I\'m bullish on all of the ARK funds.  ARKK may be one of the better ones in that group. I think most of the people in this subreddit are also bullish on this group of funds.  ARKK\'s top holdings include TSLA (10%), NVTA (7.2%), SQ (6.2%), ROKU (5.11%) CRSP (5%).  I\'m bullish on all of these companies. This is a diverse set of companies and they are not in any one sector, so it makes the fund more of a broad market fund. That said, there is also quite a bit of Tech in the fund (depending on how you categorize some of these companies - is Tesla a Tech company or a car company?)  I like the approach Cathy Wood takes with her funds, but they can be a bit volatile and should be considered a little bit risky for that reason.\n\nI don\'t think you can go wrong with the approach you are looking at.  You might want to consider an approach along the lines of:\n\nVOO - 50%\n\nSOXX - 10%\n\nICLN - 20%\n\nARKK - 20%\n\nI think this would make your portfolio reasonably well diversified without being too overloaded in any one sector.  Then, if you wanted to ""enhance"" the portfolio with a few more shares in some company that you really like, you could add a few shares of that company; or put a few shares in an ETF that has a high percentage of that company (if there is one).\n\nBest of luck to you.

While I do recognize that manufacturing is an important part of the story, having worked in a manufacturing intensive industry I can definitely say that it’s impossible to know what steps are being taken internally to address these issues and how effective they are. \n\nI always am wary when the main value-added of a particular business model is supposedly to manufacturing process. There is nothing proprietary about a manufacturing process and nothing to stop a competitor from adopting the same approach to enhance their product production. If you are correct that the consensus is signaling one way to produce, I don’t see a reason why Intel with the same level of in-house engineering/purchasing talent wouldn’t be able to resolve these issues. Not saying that happens overnight, but this is a long-term piece and I think the market/analysts are overly focused on the immediate term. \n\nAs for Mobileye, I’m not sure that’s entirely true about L2 to L5. The latest Tesla Computer and EyeQ 5 both support L5 but are being used for 2+/3 capabilities.

I know that’s repeating a line from the piece, but on a technical basis L5 will be possible as soon as the software advances to a point where it can handle the workloads - and that’s not really that far off. My goal wasn’t to suggest Mobileye will replicate 70% market share in L5 but to rather point out that Intel is practically excluded from the conversation as being a player and that shouldn’t be the case. Also, Nvidia is often cited and their AV push is one of the end markets that are regularly touted as making them a differentiator when Mobileye has a much strong competitive positioning in the space. I think the market is missing this completely. \n\nAs for Tiger Lake, I really think we need independent testing. But there are also a couple of things we already know: 50 OEM designs are shipping this fall with 150 expected by next year. People on Reddit and in this thread are overly focused on people building their own PCs or people who are aware of the benchmark differences between Ryzen and Tiger Lake when that’s just such a fractional percentage of the user market for ultra-thin high performance. And despite all of the various issues at Intel and all of the so-called domination by AMD the past couple of years, their share of the PC market is only 20%. I think that speaks directly to my point about the composition of the market itself, and as Intel muscles its way into more design ranges, I think it’s likely to put a ceiling on AMD market share advances for the time being. \n\nI think the community gets so caught up with the truly amazing turnaround by AMD (I wrote a post saying as much a couple months ago) and the conversation gets distorted into AMD having a lead when market share figures just don’t remotely suggest that. That leads me to the server discussion. I believe in your analysis your wrote about the higher core count and how Intel won’t be capable of matching AMD on that with Xeon, but that’s not how customers choose their components. It’s all about price-per-performance. They aren’t simply putting one 128 core EPYC and calling it a day. In the case of Cloudflare selecting EPYC for their new GenX server, they specifically mentioned how they chose 64 over 128 because the performance advantage was marginal for a much higher price. When you think about the volumes that these are being purchased in for edge providers/hyperscale cloud vendors, that point only gets compounded. \n\nThis is directly addressed in the write-up, where AMD had a massive lead on price-per-performance until the Xeon refresh. And I think that’s a huge reason why you’ve seen them get design wins and boost market share in data center. But again - their market share is only 10% all the while they have had this price advantage, thread count advantage, etc. So how can that be the case? Ultimately this is why I disagree about the data-centric segment being a misnomer, because they are independent markets insofar as the purchasing strategies and rationale. \n\nI think what happens most times is that folks get caught up on the technical factors when the people who are making these decisions are not engineers - they are buyers. Yes, the buyers get counseled by their technical teams but that’s just one element of it. B2B relationships, upgrade/vendor change risk, single-vendor risk, contract terms, and many more non-technical factors drive these decisions just as much if not more. And considering servers are exclusively an enterprise buyer versus the PC being a consumer buy, I think it would be a mistake to lump these together. I do business development and strategy, and I’ve been in these conversations. I just have yet to see a compelling alternative explanation for how AMD has 10% market share in data center despite everything you covered. \n\nAs for the edge server specifically, I think GPU is a wild card as you could totally be right. But edge servers will also greatly expand demand for CPU and  storage. I think the conversation on here and elsewhere is stuck in the past where there is one winner and one loser. The market is going to be too large for that, and it will absolutely require two players at least. As I said, single-vendor risk is a real thing in all industries but especially IT. It’s why Azure was able to claw out a sizeable #2 position in IaaS/PaaS when years before everyone said the “cloud wars” were over and AWS was the undisputed king. The quantities and demand is too large for one player to dominate. And because of that, I think edge servers is a trend that will lift both boats. But IoT is a different use case and integrated/hybrid graphics will be much more applicable for that type of device. So graphics could see a boost there as well. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think the conversation is inverted. People expect Intel to lose market share in legacy businesses while Nvidia and AMD are carving out dominant positions in higher-growth end markets. But Intel is also in those same end markets, and in some cases Intel has the dominant position at present. And even in the event they lose market share, these markets are so vast that it will still meaningfully drive Intel shares higher. My own 2023 projections of less than 5x P/S really is not that rosy considering NVDA is trading above 26x. But what if Intel doesn’t keep losing market share because of some of the factors I mentioned? Or what if they are successful with discrete GPUs? Those possibilities are priced into shares 0%. And I tend to think when the market overwhelmingly biased the narrative in one direction, if the narrative needs to correct, it causes a serious reversion in the share price - in both directions. \n\nGiven the strength of Intel’s financial performance despite the struggles, its attractive valuation, and its more aggressive push to catch up to advances by AMD, Intel offers much better downside protection relative to the hyper growth names that are exposed to the possibility of a tech correction in the near-term.

Always interesting to read the opposite view to what I hold. Your part about Mobileye in particular I agree with - I think similar to other car parts self-driving will be commoditised and produced by 3rd parties rather than in-house. I'm less certain that Mobileye will retain an industry lead in lvl5 autonomy than you - lvl2 and lvl5 are very different and it's difficult to tell who'll win imo.\n\nAs for the other parts, I don't agree with as much, and here's why.\n\n1.Tiger Lake. The benchmarks chosen are rather odd. While Tiger Lake does seem to be competitive and will claw back market share if Intel can produce in large quantities (which another commenter claims they can't), the performance uplift is nowhere near as much as they claim - all the benchmarks are cherry picked and presented in a manipulated way (I can explain more if you're interested, but yeah, wait for independents).\n\n2. The 'data-centric' vs 'PC-centric' is a misnomer in my opinion. Intel should report 'x86' and 'other' segments. Xeons are ultimately built on the same fundamentals as their PC parts, and underperformance in PC is a leading indicator of underperformance in datacentre CPUs. I explained [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) a few weeks ago why Intel's datacentre CPUs will, in my opinion, never be competitive with AMD on 10nm, and Tiger Lake's performance does nothing to change my argument.\n\n3. Edge computing is definitely very interesting, and likely to expand the 'pie' of servers quite significantly. I agree with your analysis that it even a marginal percentage of the market will be significant for Intel, but I doubt their Xe graphics will be able to make any impact.

But like others are pointing out, there are FUNDAMENTAL problems with Intel’s long term outlook and technology roadmap. The problems you are acknowledging (for example the 10nm disaster) is DEFINITELY NOT a “solvable supply chain problem”. Ask the other hardware engineers on this thread, making a 10/7nm chip is INCREDIBLY complicated. Intel claims that TSMC will help them cope with the shortcomings of Intels own in house fabrication process. There’s NO WAY companies like Nvidia, AMD and many other TSMC clients will allow preferential treatment in favour of Intel. Intel will have to join the back of the queue, costing them major delays in time to market.

Companies like Nvidia have achieved advantage by never publishing their instruction set at all. This is easier to do when programs are short as in GPU kernels, but in the future developers will submit programs in byte-code and they will be optimized for the specific device before delivery.

But MS is granting access to all their big games for a subscription fee and letting you play them on your TV, PC, tablet, phone... anywhere with a screen and internet.\nAlso a larger focus to backwards compatibility across multiple generations than their competitors.\n\nNintendo: Artificial scarcity drives up value and demand. They put out the miniNES, sold out. People wanted more. Instead of giving more, they put out miniSNES. same thing happened. Now they\'re starting to do it with software. I checked, and some of the launch/early release titles are going for $100+ because Nintendo isn\'t producing them anymore. Yeah maybe that\'s just Covid but its starting to feel deliberate.\n\nNvidia: PC Gaming has always been more powerful than consoles, and their new console-killer card is only $299. (This is not a new strategy, but it IS new to see PC gaming directly moving in on the console market like this).\n\nI have no idea what the good investments look like, especially since Playstation is only one part of Sony and Xbox is only one part of Microsoft, where as Nintendo and Nvidia are dedicated companies.\n\nPre-edit: Yes, Nintendo has done ""affordable next-gen"" before, but its because they\'re willing to sacrifice hardware ability. I\'m not criticizing, clearly its worked for them.

NVDA doesn’t make smart phones or smart watches and other consumer electronics.\n\nGoogle also doesn’t have a monopoly. Not on ads nor search.

There is some truth to your theory, in that most chips I am aware of on the 7nm tsmc nodes are not the monster megasaurus chip that Nvidia is using in the 3xxx series, so it very possible was part of their calculus to choose a more mature node to reduce the yield problems inherent in monster dies."", 'Amd is dead.

Just now investigations have started.\n\nYou have no idea how profitable even a brief (and this would be anything but brief) monopoly is."", 'Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they’re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It’s pretty clear that technological progress here isn’t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don’t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it’s a really young industry so there’s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it’ll have competitors nipping at it’s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn’t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn’t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I’d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that’ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other ‘classic’ treatment methods. I’m sure there’s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven’t really looked as it’s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they’re showing promise), they’ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don’t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that’s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it’s always a good idea to put money into ‘boring’ non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can’t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren’t overexposed on any one front (I’ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I’m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more ‘boring’ stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!', '&gt; It\'s their fucking chip ARM doesn\'t make chips you numbnuts.\n\nIt\'s a licensed CPU core.

If this was Intel from just one year ago I'd say ARM would become a big player in laptops, while x86 (Intel) holds its grip on datacentres. However, in laptops with the resurgence of AMD and subsequent Tiger Lake launch from Intel (assuming Intel gets decent yields even on these low power smaller die chips) means that the performance differential between ARM and x86 has been reopened. It then comes down to whether users can actually that much performance in laptops or whether battery life is the predominant concern. Personally I lean towards the former but I'm very much biased as a tech enthusiast. If it's the former, x86 wins, if it's the latter ARM wins.\n\nEither way this is wholly dependent on ARM CPUs making a big jump in performance, to Apple ARM levels, which would require a lot of focus from Nvidia on this area.\nIt's worth noting that the predominant focus of the acquisition appears from Nvidias comments + rumours to be datacentre expansion, so they might not even place that much time on laptops where they have the highest chance of success."", ""TSM/AMD/NVDA are my semiconductor triumvirate.

Whether Apple wins, AMD wins, Nvidia wins, Sony wins, Microsoft, it's hard not to see TSMC doing very well for the next few years, they're booked solid and now the most advanced foundary on earth. Buy the ones selling the shovels.  Nvidia is using Sammy N8 for their high end GPUs, but this was more for production capacity, they're also using a lot of power doing so. If AMD got really close I bet they'd go back to TSMC's more advanced nodes, they just got a discount and some excess capacity because they think they're far enough ahead.  \n \nWorked out way better, way faster than I expected so far.""]"

A few reasons I believe they are really poised to succeed in the next few years:\n\na. Covid isn\'t over- people are going to be spending more time this fall and winter indoors on their computers- this will lead to more people spending on AMD hardware.  AMD is the de facto leader for PC CPU choice at the moment- their price per performance takes a big dump on INTC at the moment and everyone knows it.  People building their own PCs are more likely choosing AMD for this reason.  \nb. The shift to an online work environment for companies and a necessary increase in server power and capacity.  AMD has positioned themselves to have competitive products in this space in terms of price per performance.  They will suck up more market share away from competitors.  \nc. The pandemic has created a perfect storm for the gaming world to grow even quicker- people are going to be coming out in droves to buy the new xbox and playstation when they come out- and AMD is supplying the CPUs for both of the new consoles.  \n\nTheir Q2 results beat estimates.  I believe their Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 results will also go huge because we will all be indoors, and people will be bored- so they will spend on PCs and the new consoles. Given they are the best CPU in terms of value on the market right now- it\'s a no brainer which one consumers will choose.\n\nI bought in earlier this year- I am holding for at least 8 more quarters while they have a technological edge on the competition and can maintain that advantage.  It is not a ""buy and hold forever"" kind of company to me, that\'s just not the nature of the semiconductor industry- their are plenty of companies competing in this space.  Nvidia acquiring arm hodlings and all of their intellectual property from softbank is also a big deal and a threat to AMD in the future, but for the next year or two its not that worrisome.', ""Just my .02$ but also look into specifically where the company is investing into as well (Products, Companies, Startups etc.).\n\nIf you judge their leadership is going in a direction you disagree with, it will let you make a better informed decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm personally holding on Nvidia however"", 'Intel is a perfect example of why fundamentals do not mean anything. \n\nFundamentally speaking they are quite a sound company, and based on my own forecasts and calculation, they are worth around 70$ a share. \n\nCall me a skeptic, but I do not think they will ever go near that price target, My entry was 58. and I got hammered. \n\nIm holding on, but I read on reddit once, in terms of intel do you want a bad company for a good price? or NVDA a good company for a bad price?\n\nIntel though, is probably more undervalued now than ever, but I doubt the market cares about tiger lake or anything else right now.', 'Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it\'s an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.

Fuck that. If earnings were to increase by 100X(10,000%), then it would have a P/E of 10. 10 is a reasonable P/E. A bit longer than I'd like to wait but nothing crazy. However, for the P/E to reach a reasonable level such as 10, we have to have unreasonable - if not impossible - earnings expectations for the future.\n\nThe same thing can be applied to changes in the stock price to determine how low a stock needs to drop before it reaches a reasonable price. NVDA has a P/E of ~150 (150 years). If its stock price were to be cut in half it would still have a high P/E of 75. It's price would need to be reduced down to 1/15th of its current price for it to have a P/E of 10 (that's quite a drop).\n\nIt's my belief that the currently high stock prices are a result of speculation, mania, and greed. Too many RH investors lack a basic understanding of value. They think all that matters is that these are well managed companies with excellent products and a bright future, or they watched a Warren Buffet interview and think that holding for 30 years will some how negate the need to make intelligent investment decisions. So now we have a bunch of simple assholes with visions of the future paying way too much for stocks. I actually agree with many of their visions of the future, but they aren't going to make any real money from them if they are paying way too much for the stocks that will manifest that future. I also think value will ultimately win, as it always does, and so these stocks are destined to fall. It's only a matter of how long the mania can be sustained.\n\nSorry if this is too much. I may have gotten carried away.\n\n(Disclaimer: P/E isn't the end all be all, and can often be interpreted as a premium or discount due to future expectations of performance. Stocks with low P/Es are often poor performing companies with bleak futures and I would generally recommend staying away from them. However, you can sometimes find some hidden value. Sometimes companies have unjustly low P/E's for trifling reasons. E.g. they aren't cool, maybe their industry is boring, maybe some petty piece of news did damage to the stock price while earnings remained unaffected, or maybe they went through a rough time recently but you expect them to recover. These are the value stocks to seek. They generally have some decent upside potential while the downside remains low because their price has already been beaten down low.\n\nAlso if you're wondering why P/E 10, well it's not a rule and is ultimately arbitrary. It's just an easy number to work with while also being within a reasonable P/E range.)"", ""You should never invest with money that you may need in the near future.  Always think long term to ensure that you are able to weather any downturns in the market.  With that being said APPL and NVDA are both great companies, although a bit overvalued.  Apple has their iPhone 12 release mid October which should push it up a bit from this week's lows.  Not really sure what good news NVDA has coming up.  Of course we also have the presidency in November which could go either way.  Many think the market will tank if Trump is not reelected.  Try not to sweat this week to much and especially today.  Today was a quadruple witching hour which pushed the market low.

What's so crazy about VR is that the ultimate thing it might disrupt is the need for money. It's possible that in a few decades, we will spend all of our time in virtual worlds. Who needs money in the real world when you can live like a king in a virtual world?\n\nHow best to capitalize on VR? Facebook is obviously investing a lot into VR, but I haven't been impressed with them. I believe they are focusing more on trying to earn revenue from their walled garden store and building a social network for advertising. They don't seem to be pushing the cutting edge of virtual reality fidelity. I believe Apple will release some amazing hardware, potentially blowing away anything from Facebook. Apple seems more concerned with augmented reality right now. I don't see them focusing on VR, since gaming has never been their forte. \n\nOverall, I'd say that Nvidia is the best play for betting on VR. Creating life-like VR will require monumental advancements in computational power, and no one is closer to the forefront than Nvidia. I also like Apple as a play on AR glasses. Facebook is actually a good bet if you think VR will become popular but not revolutionary. They will make a lot of money on their Oculus platform with games and ads. I also like Microsoft, AMD, Qualcomm, and Google -- maybe even Tesla for Neuralink. I guess the short answer is just buy big tech!"", ""It doesn't matter. At one point, Tesla had Nvidia chips in their cars. The way he worded his reply makes him wrong. If he meant something else then he can learn to articulate better."", ""AMD is smaller and has more room to grow, but that also means it needs to take marketshare from established people or grow the entire market without having that growth taken from them. \n\nIt's got more room for rapid short term growth but higher risk and potentially less stability.

However, NVDA and AMD make 2 completely different products. You need both CPU and GPU for a pc or any computer system to run. A better comparison would be TSM vs INTC vs AMD. NVDA is in a class by itself since there are no better GPU makers on the market', 'Nvidia is probably seeing the typical amount of demand for any of their previous launches right now. It seems supply this time around was extremely limited, so demand seems much higher when in reality all of their products sold out because they didn’t have very many of them.', ""True enough. Personally, NVDA and its competitors are not in my portfolio or on my watch list. P/E is way too high for gamers to support it imo. Maybe AI will get them there, but that's outside of my scope of knowledge. Capacitors, on the other hand, are more my speed. But, yah, I'm not long or short."", ""Nvidia makes chips that can be used for FSD. Tesla's first gen chip was using Nvidia till they decided to make their own.

So I sold and walked away with -$1000 because an inverse stock doesn't grow like normal stocks they decay.\n\n\nAnyway it was a good lesson to learn and I've learned more since then.\n\nFor the most part stocks are a guessing game, but if you want Consistant gains then invest in indux funds, if you want slightly higher gains invest in the top tech companies, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple and HOLD for as long as possible.\n\nIf you want to gamble, invest in new IPOs that look promising.\n\nDo NOT invest in too many different companies at once, and do NOT invest in over valued stocks just because they appear like they are making a lot of money.\n\nFor example, AMD and Nvidia went up 300% over the last year, and mostly flatlined over the last month. They are incredibly over valued.  Instead think about Intel who hasn't seen any growth but pays good dividend rates and are bound to see a spike sooner or later.\n\nAnyway I'm still planning on pulling all of my money out of the stock market at a gain in the near future.

Their silicone process produces higher quantities of higher quality, more energy efficient components at a lower error rate.\n\nAnd while AMD has a bit of a reputation for rough GPU launches, they've steadily increased their professionalism and have hit several home runs with their CPU and the 5000 series GPU, not to mention their hardware presence on all the upcoming gaming consoles. With this, their hardware will set the standard for what type of architecture most games are programmed on. Games will be programmed to have their most functionality on AMD hardware. \n\nI think AMD is better positioned to be the leader in gaming graphics this generation, and has plenty of room for growth."", 'seriously. They also missed out a lot of hype due to shortage. And tthere are also issues with the capacitors.

Big into Nvidia obviously, and started a position in CRSR @15.5 the other day. Both fantastic holds the coming months.', 'You will find a more thorough explanation by searching ""3080 capacitors"" on YouTube. The gist of the issue is that there are cards in the wild that have inappropriate capacitors for the purpose of high end graphics processing. From what I\'ve heard it will mostly effect overclocking (if we\'re being honest most wont OC their cards until games get more intense to render or displays become more demanding). These capacitors are more susceptible to noise at higher clock frequencies. This means that if you overclock or enable boost or whatever, you run the risk of exceeding the intended spec of those overlooked components. It leads to logic states that the GPU cannot resolve, which leads to crashes. \n\nI am unclear if this is going to fall on 3rd party companies for misrepresenting their products, or Nvidia for the design spec. My guess would be the former, but popular opinion is fickle.', ""Hard to say what to think of your portfolio without knowing more about your situation and goals\n\nI'm 28 and make a lot of money.

By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it\'s an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM**  \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors.  This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan.  This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy/Oil\n\nCloud Computing is another sector to consider. Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nOther sector funds that I like include:\n\n**Health Care:**  FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:**  IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:**  IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:**  ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:**  BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n*I\'m not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

I’m a bit of a computer nerd and a huge gamer so I have a fairly large position in ESPO as well as a large position in AAPL, MSFT (although those pick go far beyond gaming) and smaller positions in XSD, AMD, and NVDA to further increase my exposure to semiconductors. In fact, I’m so bullish on that sector that I also have a growing position in ARKW, as it is an actively managed ETF that specifically owns disruptive internet technologies (it has a much higher expense ratio because it’s actively managed; look into expense ratios when picking ETFS), and HUYA, which is something like Twitch in China. If clean energy ends up being your thing then you will be able to pick companies in that sector eventually, it’s not mine though, so I get exposure to that sector through the ETF ICLN to stay diversified so I’m not too tech heavy.

Obviously it\'s an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VXUS - Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I\'m also going to include EFA and EEM. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. EFA is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and EEM is rated only 5.7/10. EEM appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. EFA appears to be more tilted toward the European market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VOO/SPY - VOO and SPY are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like QQQ, VTI, VTG, VOOG and SPYG.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWF - This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than VOO/SPY, less volatile than QQQ.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWM - for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ICLN/TAN/FAN - These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARK group of funds: ARKG, ARKF, ARKK ARKW, ARKQ, PRNT and IZRL. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARKG - Genomic RevolutionARKF - FintechARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligencePRNT - 3D printing technologyIZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XLV - Health CareXLK - TechnologyXLY - Consumer DiscretionaryXLF - FinancialXLU - Utilities  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I\'m adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  WCLD, SKYY, CLOU, BUG and XIKT. Of these WCLD has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in WCLD include ZM, PLAN, CRM, CRWD, ZEN, WDAY, TENB, PCTY, DDOG, BL.  Many of these are likely to also appear in QQQ, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Read through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A nice portfolio might look something like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - VXUS - International  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10% each in four sector funds of your choice  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hope this helps.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\'m not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

Borrowing money on MARGIN is the other way to lose money that is not yours. Those two ways are the only ways to lose more than you put in as far as I know. Stick only to Equity trading or Dividing investing and you should be fine. Equity trading is when you put money into stock(s) that you pick and watch it grow for long periods of time. Dividend investing is picking specific stock(s) that offer a special 'rebate' if you buy them. Dividend stocks give you an added bonus cashback on a regular bases just for investing in them. Dividend stocks don't usually grow a whole lot, they are really for that little bit of cash you get from them on those cash incentives. From my experience you gain a lot more money from equity investing into tech stocks than you do from dividend investing. The benefit of dividend investing in my opinion is only when you have a few hundred thousand dollars or more and want a slow steady return to retire with. The benefit of equity investing on the other hand, is that you gain money much quicker. Equity investing is fun because you can move your money around as you see things growing and dipping. Best though not to move your money around too much because then you'll pay more in taxes. Best to pick long term sure growers that tend to have a steady ytd growth for 10 years or more like AAPL or NVDA or TSLA.\n\nSince you admit you're new let me add something you didn't ask but I feel is very important. Any profit you make on any way you chose to invest you will be taxed. This is called capital gains tax. As long as you don't sell any of your stocks after gaining, for more than 365 days, you will pay the lower bracket of taxes of your state you live in which is approximately 10%. If you do sell any of your stocks after gaining, and it's been less than 365 days since you bought it, you will pay the higher bracket of tax for the state you live in which is 20%. You only pay tax on the profit, not on the total.\n\nSo let's say you bought loads of one stock for a million bucks. You gained one dollar of profit (capital gains) on the 364th day after buying it. If you sold those stocks on that day you will pay 20% tax on your incometax for that one dollar. If you wait till after the 365th day to sell those stocks, you will pay 10% on that one dollar on your incometax. Ofcourse I'm exaggerating the numbers just so you can see it doesn't matter how much you have invested, it only matters what you GAINED."", ""We have more robinhood investors than ever before.

NVDA/AMD are likely also fairly or undervalued compared to the broader markets - which are grossly overvalued.\n\nFor AMD - they will soon be revenue constrained based on TSMC capacity. ATM, it looks like they're selling everything they produce. As more and more of their sales mix shifts to TSMC fabs, they will become more constrained. Even with the better products, they will only ever be able to grow revenue by a predictable amount. They're consistent, but with this constraint in place, I don't know how you can justify their current valuation.\n\nNVDA - I think they are currently worth more than INTC, while INTC makes twice the operating income that NVDA makes in total revenue. Not only this, but INTC is actually still growing revenue. \n\nThe whole TAM is expanding, such that even though NVDA and AMD have comparable or superior products, INTC is actually still growing at a respectable pace and generating considerably more revenue and profit. Part of this comes down to the fact that INTC is less supply constrained - huge fab space. Part of this is that even though AMD products are generally superior, they aren't superior for the average consumer - i.e. people buying laptops for general work, people buying desktops for general work. INTC wins in gaming, but AMD works in productivity (parallel workloads), but has a worse software stack.\n\nNVDA is growing in the server space, but not unperturbed. Competition is growing faster than NVDA is improving, and this space will be under attack in the coming half-decade. On the gaming front, NVDA is seeing it's gap close against AMD, but NVDA still has a far superior software stack. INTC is entering the GPU space in both server and consumer segments. This will still take them time, but in this time, they'll likely also remedy a lot of their FAB issues.\n\nOverall, I think AMD and NVDA have more downside than upside risk atm. They're both very vulnerable to competition, fighting for fab space and very vulnerable to any trade issues (fabs are overseas).\n\nJust my own thoughts, though."", 'NVDA rocks- best performer I have by far- I like it at 500 but that is probably not going to happen', 'last time was hanging onto SOXS just as Nvidia went to the moon.

Unfortunately, the way stocks work is that investors price in 5 years of growth and revenue NOW and sometimes get way too ahead of themselves and then the company is blown up to valuations that are completely disconnected from its current or near future earnings.

But if you’re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you’ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both ‘non-diversified’ ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don’t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on “green revolution” stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I’m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It’s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I’ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They’ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They’re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on ‘em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that’s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn’t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they’ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat’s my 10 cents.

2020-10-09,"[""My money is on AMD and AMD is positioned for a bright future. I think a lot of people discredit the fact that AMD is on a growth trajectory, therefore, a big part of revenue goes into  R&amp;D activities. This has rewarded them handsomely. They slowly started eating into Intel's lunch and will only continue to capture more market share. They are into processors and GPUs; that should tell you that Su is not afraid to roll her sleeve and go head-to-head against Intel and Nvidia. Also, great businesses leaders have a knack for determining the growth areas and perhaps Su knows it with Xilinx. Personally, when I invest my capital, I look at two things- a) TAM and b) leadership capabilities. The latter is hard to quantify so a lot of times, people end of investing in companies with high TAM and poor leadership, leading to capital depreciation over time. In my opinion, Su is a game changer. She is treated like Musk on this board. As long as Su is the CEO, you have have a peaceful sleep at night.\n\nAnd one more thing--there will be a lot of boomers telling you to buy Intel because it is cheap. But know that there is a reason things are cheap. If they were that attractive, the market would be willing to pay a premium. That is why stocks like Zoom, Shopify, and Tesla will always be devoured by value investors because they are looking for cheap bargains. Fact is, good things are never cheap in life. My brother invested significantly in Shop in 2015 and just paid off the mortgage from Shop profits. Meanwhile, I was waiting for a strong pullback or a bad year, none of which happened. So the summary is, be willing to pay a premium for a growth stock, and research the C suite and the CEO thoroughly before investing. I will also add that Intel is on a downward spiral like ExxonMobil. Boomers like Exxon because it pays dividends and they like Intel for the same reason not that they are interested in seeing capital grow 10 folds."", '##Top trending tickers, sentiments, and options on /r/stocks for the day of October 09, 2020.\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Tickers:\n\n**Ticker**|**Company**|**Mentions**|**Bulls / Bears**|**Price**|**Change**|**P/E**\n:-:|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nMSFT|Microsoft Corporation|126|80.00% / 20.00%|$215.81|2.48%|37.44\nAAPL|Apple Inc.|123|77.78% / 22.22%|$116.97|1.74%|35.56\nAMD|Advanced Micro Device|82|81.25% / 18.75%|$83.10|-3.94%|165.21\nTSLA|Tesla, Inc.|71|87.50% / 12.50%|$434.00|1.90%|1115.68\nAMZN|Amazon.com, Inc.|57|80.00% / 20.00%|$3286.65|3.01%|126.33\nICLN|Exchange Traded Fund|56|100.00% / 0.00%|$21.40|1.57%|-\nSQ|Square, Inc.|53|66.67% / 33.33%|$187.28|2.06%|415.25\nQQQ|Exchange Traded Fund|52|88.89% / 11.11%|$285.71|1.53%|-\nVOO|Exchange Traded Fund|43|100.00% / 0.00%|$318.58|0.89%|-\nNIO|NIO Limited|42|100.00% / 0.00%|$21.47|0.14%|-\nNVDA|NVIDIA Corporation|39|50.00% / 50.00%|$550.51|-0.55%|100.94\nARKK|Exchange Traded Fund|36|100.00% / 0.00%|$102.76|2.18%|-\nFB|Facebook, Inc.|35|100.00% / 0.00%|$264.45|0.26%|33.74\nWMT|Walmart Inc.|35|66.67% / 33.33%|$142.78|1.00%|22.76\nDIS|The Walt Disney Compa|31|100.00% / 0.00%|$124.98|1.54%|-\nKO|The Coca-Cola Company|31|100.00% / 0.00%|$50.81|0.69%|23.90\nBABA|Alibaba Group Holding|30|75.00% / 25.00%|$299.74|-0.27%|31.03\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Options:\n\n**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Expiration**\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nFB|$270|Call|9/18\nICLN|$20|Call|10/16\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Sentiment:\n\n**Sentiment**|**Comments**|**%**\n:--|:--|:--\nBullish|141|72.68%\nNeutral|849|-\nBearish|53|27.32%\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Other Data:\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Bullish\n\n**Comments Searched:** 1043\n\n**Newly Trending Tickers:** KO, BABA\n\n────────────────\n\nYou can view all top trending tickers on /r/RedditTickers.\n\nNotice an error or have questions?

If you can buy 20 or 30 stocks then it makes sense to take some moonshots with smaller growth companies. For me, the only one that I would even consider doing that with is TSLA. I think if you\'re going to do this you have to at least try for some safety in capital preservation, picking companies that are highly unlikely to fail, and also unlikely to be bought out which could stop your potential for growth just 1 year into the experiment. Companies that are big enough to just make acquisitions because they can pivot if needed.\n\nI think 10 years is a reasonable time frame to still expect things to stay on course. 20 years would honestly be too far away and I\'d just buy some stable dividend stocks like KO, DIS, and PFE.\n\nFor 10 years, my 5 would be:\n\nNVDA -- already growing with multiple avenues for continued growth, stable growth industry in gaming, including potential blockbusters including AI and self driving.\n\nAMZN -- Assuming you also get to keep any broken apart pieces, eCommerce is still growing, and they have AWS. Hidden diversification.\n\nILMN -- For the healthcare sector, should also be able to leverage AI/data analytics. Not the fastest growing company in the field, but they\'re already profitable, unlike NVTA which might run itself into the ground if capital ever becomes more difficult to come by. That 5-10 year time frame is about where I expect genomics to really become commercially important.\n\nAAPL -- They\'ve won over the current and next generations with their hardware, and also expanding into services for more stable recurring revenue, and a ton of cash. Their iPhone growth is only slowing because they\'ve almost reached saturation among lucrative customers, but iOS could become the Windows of the 90\'s and early 2000\'s, except they get a cut of all the software sales. Even if they start to decline, they can pay out a dividend for a long time.\n\nTSLA -- This would be my ""home run"" swing, as I still believe at worst they are a popular car company, could potentially become a really popular car company with Uber/Lyft built in, and have the massive potential of energy storage and delivery.

NVDA for example was bought for the long term but +50% in 5.5 months is more than I ever anticipated. Any thoughts?\n\nI bought ACB, CTEA &amp; SVM as a punt off the back of an investopedia recommendation which I'm sort of regretting but I didn't buy with the short term in mind so I'm not sweating about those big losses right now and I didn't invest heavily either.\n\nAs you can tell I'm not an emotional investor and I'm obviously making rookie mistakes but overall I'm happy with how things are looking for the future of my portfolio, but what do you guys think?

No debts.\n\n\\- Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Beyond this, the company pays a reliable dividend yielding 6% at current prices with a payout ratio of less than 25% of earnings and a mere 15.6% of FCF. It’s TTM free cash flow is consistently above $1 billion, this year hitting almost $1.5 billion, which is good for a margin of 12.5% of revenue. The stock’s P/E at its current price is below 4, and honestly, I can’t for the life of me figure out why.\n\nEPD - One of America’s largest midstream oil companies, EPD’s share price was hammered in March and hasn’t recovered at the same rate as the broader market. I’m a huge fan of the stock for a few simple reasons: for starters, the entry cost to the pipeline industry is enormous and gives EPD a significant competitive advantage with its already massive pipeline network. EPD has a great credit rating, and what (relatively) little debt it does have on its balance sheet is in the form of corporate bonds, not bank debt, which gives the business lots of operational leeway. Furthermore, having debt-to-equity of only 115% in a highly indebted sector ensures that it will be the survivor in the event of an industry downturn. While the rest of the energy sector was hit hard from the oil crisis earlier this year, EPD’s earnings and cash flow hardly even declined. You see, most of it’s earnings rely on long-term contracts with buyers, most of whom have high credit ratings of their own. This gives EPD another significant competitive edge in downturns like the one we saw this year. The final reason I love this stock is quite simple: the dividend yields 10.5%. Enough said.\n\nMOMO: This is by far the most speculative addition to the list, but my eyes tell me that this stock is too good of an opportunity to pass up on. Momo is China’s leading dating app developer, and has grown its earnings at a ridiculous rate of 40.8% per year for the past 5 years. While I don’t expect growth to continue at this rate going forward, I do expect growth much higher than Mr. Market seems to anticipate, having given the stock a valuation of 7x TTM earnings. The balance sheet is, once again, in an extremely favorable position. Debt-to-equity is a mere 36.2%, and the company’s cash position exceeds its debt by $1.07 billion. The company also doesn’t face the headwinds of other Chinese social networking products like TikTok, given that Momo markets its products to Chinese citizens almost exclusively and doesn’t face any pushback from American regulators. Management is heavily invested, with the CEO owning over 19% of the company’s outstanding shares. That’s always a great sign. The company has net profit margins of almost 18%, and earns over 21% on equity and over 11% on assets. I love the company, and I love the price even more.\n\nIf there’s anything to take away from my list, or this thread in general, it’s this: while the volatility and uncertainty in asset markets can be scary and destroy a lot of wealth (temporarily, anyway), it also creates phenomenal buying opportunities and CREATES more wealth than it destroys in the long-term. However, volatile markets create as many great buying opportunities as they do poor ones, so for the sake of acknowledging that, here’s a few stocks that I wouldn’t touch at current prices:\n\nTSLA, NVDA, SQ.\n\nThese also happen to be the darlings of this subreddit (and the market as a whole at this point), so I’d like to say definitively that I do not think these are bad companies. Quite the contrary actually. I simply think they’re not worth the prices they’re trading for, and the downside is massive at those prices.', 'I’d add NVDA or even DPZ to that list.', ""I'd slowly start diversifying into other companies you know and are interested in. For me that would be AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AZMN, WMT, UPS and 1 or 2 risky but smaller positions, like NIO (Chinese EV man.) and a biotech stock of choice."", 'Buy Nvidia imo', ""Yup. Momentum and to jack up the price for acquisitions. (See Nvidia).\n\nBob's need trading skill now!!

You might want to wait for a pullback. In my opinions, NVDA will always be ahead of competition (and a better investment than AMD in the long run). The same applies to TSLA.\n\nI like the potentials of PLUG and hydrogen fuel cells in more commercial applications as technology advances allowing hydrogen fuel cells to become more cost efficient and feasible. Also, demand for clean energy will continue to grow in the upcoming years. Personally, I think hydrogen fuel cells and electric can coexist. Note that PLUG has been around for a while and has yet turned a profit. But they seem to be on the right track for huge growth with the recent developments and partnerships. \n\nOf all the stocks that I mentioned, NVDA, AMZN, APPL, and PLUG are currently in my portfolio. My biggest position is NVDA but my avg. is also very low at under $200.']"

What is this company's competitive advantage? What products do they sell?\n\n2. What is my goal here? Am I looking for a short term run or long term? \n\n3. Am I risk adverse or a risk taker? \n\n4. Is this industry profitable? Does it have growth potential? \n\n5. What is the current economic condition? \n\nThese are basic questions that will help guide you in making an informed decision. \n\nHere is an example below: \n\n1. Let's look at Apple. This company clearly has an array of product lines. Their ecosystem seems to be their competitive advantage. When you buy an iphone, you're most likely going to use Apple pay, Apple music, iCloud service, or even a watch. They make it so easy for you because everything is connected and simple. \n\n2. This really depends on how much time you have to keep up with upcoming news and etc. If you're in it for the long run, you shouldn't really care about day to day fluctuations. If one day the stock goes down $5, don't panic sell. Ask yourself, did the fundamentals changed? Why did I invest in this stock? \n\n3. Risk adverse or risk taker will help you decide which stocks to even look at. If you're a risk adverse, consider big companies like Apple or Microsoft. You know that they will always be around and people will always consume their products. If you're a risk taker, you can look at companies that have huge growth potential. This can be AMD, Nvidia or Shopify. It's obviously more risky but have a huge upside in reward. \n\n4. Let's refer back to Apple here. Apple is not just an iphone company anymore. They're tapping into services, which includes fitness, icloud, music, app store, tv+, and the list goes on. Now if they didn't really pivot themself in this position and was just selling iPhones, then I'd say they have very little to no growth. \n\n5. Current economic state will help you get a sense of outlook. For example, COVID is an issue right now. Unemployment is high. Are stimulus checks coming in? What is the government doing to help? If people are unemployed, what happens to people's buying power. In order for the economy to do well, people need to be consuming. With no raises, pay cuts, stimulus checks, how are people going to consume things? \n\nI hope this helps you in some kind of way.\n\nGoodluck!"", 'NW $4.9 million\n\nReal Estate: 42%\nEquities: 42%\nGold: 10%\nCrypto: 2%\nRest in cash \n\nMy advice: always pretend you’re poor, it’s the stoic way.\n\nEDIT: equity portfolio is mostly AMZN TTD TSLA MSFT SHOP FB AAPL GOOGL ISRG NVDA', 'Ehh toyota Daimler really?

This can be a big advantage (especially in small caps) and many retail investors do not possess these skills. That doesn\'t make it an immoral advantage.\n\nThe temporary dip only costs money if you sell, and if your conviction on a company is high, then you have no reason to sell. If your conviction is not high, then you probably shouldn\'t hold the stock. Furthermore anybody can employ strategies to minimize risks or even play along with the short sellers (buying puts, spreads, etc.).\n\nI held both NVDA and SHOP through short attacks from Citron (who is probably one of the more ""manipulative"" short sellers) because I thought the short arguments were quite weak. My conviction was high on both companies and they\'re now both 10X higher a few years later.\n\nCitron\'s been crushed on their recent Peloton campaign so don\'t think that short sellers never lose. They definitely do and the market doesn\'t always agree with them.\n\nOverall, most short sellers do far more good than harm in markets.']"

This new strategy seems interesting and I think it is particularly telling that many experts (i.e. Barrons) almost unanimously list it as a buy even though the stock went up $10 dollars a share this week alone.\n\nABBV ---- Seems like a solid stock with a fair amount of potential products coming out in 2021. Plus, they have a hefty dividend (they're a dividend aristocrat) and have the best selling drug in the world, Humira.\n\nNVDA ----- Incredibly solid company with ridiculous annual growth over the past few years. Regardless of whether the ARMS acquisition happens, it seems like a real champion in a very lucrative field (semiconductors).\n\nMSGE ---- this one is purely speculative. It seems like New York City is shutting down again, which I imagine will be detrimental to MSGE (which owns Madison Square Garden and other entertainment complexes).

I do financial analysis for every company I consider buying because ultimately cash flow is the only thing that matters in the long term.\n\nNow if you plug NVDA into a simple DCF equation, it looks overvalued.

Intel is literally running a 14nm chip on 150 watts just to compete with an AMD chip of 75-90 watts.\n\nNot only that, AMD offers more number of cores and a cheaper platform to build PCs on. AMD is able to offer more cores because 7nm processors have higehr yield than 14nm and also because they build cores in forms of ""chiplets"" which lets them mix and match processor cores in a significantly low cost manner.\n\nAMD is legit years ahead of Intel at this point in time.

Get out if you still can, cuz it\'s literally going to zero. x86 chips are inefficient against ARM and will eventually lose out to ARM (already are to be frank).

The dangers of being a Wall St baby for too long I guess - you get really good at 'business efficiency' and less good at other stuff I guess."", 'I see a lot of mentions of AMD, and a bunch of Nvidia, but almost nothing about ARM. Sure, AMD is competitive with Intel for x86 and Nvidia is getting a lot of attention for GPU-powered machine learning, but don\'t sleep on ARM. We\'re probably on the precipice of a huge shift to ARM in the datacentre that\'s being driven by public cloud providers.\n\nConsider AWS which have been rolling out ARM ""Graviton2"" virtual machines all year:\n\n1. Compared to their x86 counterparts, the Graviton2 are faster for many workloads, are more thermally efficient, and cost less for both Amazon _and_ their customers. AWS instances are billed by the second and usually autoscaled, meaning customers will launch and destroy dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of VMs every day. Servers are not hand-configured one at a time and named after Star Wars characters -- you can\'t launch a thousand servers a day that way -- instead they\'re built through automation. This isn\'t just for speed, it\'s for repeatability so that when you boot up a server, you don\'t have to second-guess that it\'s going to be precisely configured already. So, if you already have the automation in place, and only needed to adjust one variable to start launching ARM machines instead of x86 for less money and more performance, why wouldn\'t you?\n\n2. ""That\'s not fair -- the software all has to be re-compiled or even rewritten to work on ARM!"" That\'s true! I\'ll get to that in a moment. Here\'s a type of server you can use right now without rewriting _any_ software: managed database instances. One of the hardest things to do well in a tech org is to run ""stateful"" workloads like databases, which is why all the major cloud providers offer fully-managed database services of many flavours of SQL, caching, and NoSQL databases. Click a few buttons and get MySQL, with patching, backups, and auto-failover managed by the cloud provider. Postgres already runs on ARM, and the data stored by Postgres doesn\'t care whether the CPU architecture that stored it was ARM or x86 or PowerPC. Replace your managed database instances powered by x86 with the ARM version and start getting that better (and cheaper) performance without having to rewrite anything, _and_ keep all your data. No migration, just shut it down, and turn it back on again with new CPUs. The public cloud providers are going to make a killing on this and they know it.\n\n3. Ok, so what _about_ the apps the tech org writes to power the business? The things that have to be recompiled and maybe even heavily rewritten? Pipelines rebuilt? And the servers underneath them, won\'t the management software also need to support ARM? Yeah, that\'s going to take some time and effort, but maybe less than you think. Workload management is becoming increasingly commodified. Orgs that have existing IT assets and tooling will have to make investments in converting their pipeline if they think it\'s worthwhile (and it may not be in the short term). New startups or new working groups within existing organizations though have no such baggage. They probably won\'t even run their own servers. Fully-managed containerization platforms or partially-managed platforms powered by something like Kubernetes (think GKE, EKS, AKS) mean that the cloud provider deals with running the servers, and you just ship them the workload. Are you in a golang shop? Target ARM and push.\n\nA tailwind to all this is Apple\'s shift to ARM, and while it may not have an outsized effect on the datacentre, it doesn\'t hurt.\n\nLong story short: AMD and Nvidia will make things interesting for Intel in the coming years, but if you want to know where the industry is going, look to ARM.\n\nEDIT: Lot of comments pointing out Nvidia\'s ownership of ARM. Yep, I get it, this is an investing sub and readers are going to be looking at this at a business perspective. ARM is a major _architectural_ change in technology though, which is typically a hard sell, but is being made not only possible but desirable due to the commodification of the datacentre. If you want to buy the winner then buy the winner, but no one is asking why ARM is all of a sudden positioned to succeed in the datacentre now when the chips have been around for decades.', '“Has been leading” say hello to NVDA boomer', ""The simple reason they set their bean counters to talk about all the beans they've counted, is because that's all they have.

They haven’t even figured out a solid laptop strategy yet. Still struggling in the data center.\n\nAMD’s answer to ARM is “keep doing what they’re doing”.

However, if the deal with Nvidia + ARM goes through I expect they will instead focus on a RISC V architecture. \n\nAMD’s laptop strategy is also “keep doing what we’re doing, and print money doing it”. Their Renoir APUs were incredible over the last year or so and more and more laptop OEMs seem to be picking them up for this coming year. \n\nData Center is actually both harder for them and a non-issue at the same time.

I think you kind of have to step away from these echo chambers, as they will be pushed to justify other competitors' evaluations and look at the numbers a bit more. For example, right now the big thing is that Intel is feeling pressure from AMD on the datacenter. However, if you actually look at AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Custom (where they report server sales) that shift is not showing. That segment has had flat sales quarter after quarter and year or year. Now that can change as Q3 earnings are coming up and that is a number I will be paying attention to. This is different from their Computing and Graphics division which is the one that is growing. So just strong sentiment around Intel at the moment as people will pick and dissect any report. The critic is valid but somewhat ridiculous give the evaluation the market is giving actually crappy business in other sectors. Wall Street doesn't care about FCF atm, they want to see growth doesn't matter if it even translates to the bottom line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said Intel fundamentals are solid imo and they got a decent buffer to get back on track to get sentiment back on their side. Stuff does get delayed all the time with them. Like someone else one else said of the stronger bull cases in Intel can make a killer product to turn it around. They have stuff in the works and spend loads on R&amp;D. Intel isn't focused on keeping the consumer high-end desktop market like Wall Street thinks it is and extrapolating AMD's win there to evaluate all of Intel on. That is a declining market and a win there won't even move the needle for them as much as the effort would take to beat AMD there. Intel is more focused on things that will really move the needle for them. As long as they keep notebook sales going up and their market share in the server space they are fine giving the desktop market to AMD (just look at AMD's gross margins). There are several different barriers AMD has to break to really win in the datacenter. Nvidia is the big threat here as they are moving into more datacenter stuff and with ARM they would probably move more in the CPUs in multiple applications that Intel has a stronghold on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPromising things I see in Intel that if executed correctly can change sentiment:\n\n\\- Saphire Lake Server CPU with CXL should change datacenter stuff a lot\n\n\\- MobileEye (duh)\n\n\\- Optane (3D Xpoint).

How these do will point to if they can really keep up with ARM and different CPU workloads.\n\n\\- Habana Labs AI training chips. This is one of Nvidia's biggest bull cases and this is Intel's second attempt at this. I am keeping a close eye on this one as AI training will be a big market. I think Intel's engineering knowledge could bring some decent gain to that market to allow them to get a piece of that pie.\n\n\\- Discrete GPUs. The money really isn't at the consumer level it is at the datacenter level. Nvidia has a huge lead in the data center GPUs here and it is their cash cow based on AI training. Intel also trying this will help it in a lot of other efforts.\n\n\\- And a lot of other stuff. Intel is in a lot. They are spreading their bets among a lot of stuff and with their cash flow + talent they can do that.\n\nIntel has some buffer here on missteps on execution to turn the ship around to find something to grow and get multiple expansion going. They kind of need to be head down for a while. Everyone is like is Intel going to be an IBM or will be a MSFT with the Nadella pivot. I am leaning more to the MSFT theory.

They haven’t even figured out a solid laptop strategy yet.\n\nAMD has a lot of weaknesses despite its great PR and a few hits.\n\nNVIDIA has ARM for an advantage but as things move towards the cloud they still need to figure out how to get ARM solidly into the data center. So far efforts have not panned out. No matter how cheap they make it people still aren’t biting. They’ve been trying for years now.\n\nIntel right now still owns the data center market. If they can come up with enough products to keep Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc happy... they’ll do at least ok. Their laptop offerings are ok for now. Mobile never really took off. Desktop is on shaky ground.\n\n\nThere is no safe bet here. Anyone who’s confident in any of AMD, Intel or Nvidia is on crack or just trying to pump and dump stock.', ""INTC's tech trajectory is now several years behind AMD, by the time Intel has promised 7nm chips AMD is projected to be on or close to 4nm. NVDA and AAPL are both diving heavily into ARM CPU development which is strictly superior to X86 when scaled at the same level for both consumer and server usage. There's absolutely no way Intel GPUs are going to remotely approach something that gamers or scientists ever care about. Intel's profit margins have only been good because they've had a monopoly on single core and high end X86 performance, but now they're losing at their own greatest strength and they have no alternatives. They're in serious trouble."", 'There are plenty of reasons to invest in Intel however short term gains is not it. It\'s possible that  they will be range bound for months between say 45-55 even if you think long-term they will do good. But that said here are my thoughts:\n\n**Macroeconomic Trends**\n\nThe stock market is nuts right now, AMD/Nvida ARE eating Intel\'s lunch but at the same time intel is immensely more profitable than both companies COMBINED. The valuations for both AMD/Nvidia assume they will grow immensely over the next decade and basically ""can\'t"" Mess up. Nvidia needs to be the undisputed king of GPU and AMD needs to basically eat half of Intel\'s market share just for TODAY\'s price to make sense. How do they grow from here? This is true of much the market, Zoom, Tesla, etc... There\'s a potential pop or at least stagnation coming for trendy companies. Short term it\'s hard to predict when the gravy train will end. But Intel has much less downside from these numbers than many companies (including Nvidia/AMD)\n\n**The Recent Drop**\n\nIntel\'s government and datacenter sales dropped 37% this quarter. This is FOLLOWING 30% increases for two quarters. What likely happened is as covid hit governments and enterprises massively bought up new servers to service the WFH world and now that covid is unwinding combined with a really rough economic environment (unemployment, slowing of economy, etc...) those entities are ""good"" with their current server capacity since their recent upgrades. For the year these sales are still up.\n\nIt\'s important to note these numbers do NOT include cloud sales. Cloud sales were up 15% this quarter. Is 15% good? I don\'t actually know because if the market grew by say 50% it\'s possible intel got 15% and AMD got the rest. That said Intel\'s PE ratio is so low this is fine, and AMD\'s is so high that this MUST be true. Also a cloud CPU is likely more efficient than an enterprise one as many players share it in VMs and such. Meaning if every single government/enterprise datacenter moved to the cloud it\'s very likely Intel would sell less CPUs is overall demand stayed static.\n\nAll in all this is to say the recent drop seems a bit of an overreaction, it\'s not great news but also not terrible and unpredicted.\n\n**Manufacturing Woes**\n\nThis is the big one. Constant delays of 10nm, 7nm. Currently 10nm is subpar in yields. That said their newest fab just came online allowing them to sell more 10nm. Next year they will be releasing their first desktop 10nm CPU (after one final hurrah of 14nm...). This means Intel is very behind TSMC on manufacturing capabilities. That said until this latest AMD CPU Intel wasn\'t actually that far behind for many applications. It was the single core king, and may still be for non consumer, but we don\'t know yet. This means despite AMD having all of TSMC\'s manufacturing prowess it\'s unable to significantly pull ahead of Intel. We\'re not talking an order of magnitude, AMD is better by a manageable percent. This means when intel figures it out and gets their act together their CPU designs will very likely be able to beat AMD\'s. \n\nNext is the possibility of abandoning their fabs to use TSMC - Intel could strike a deal to kill their 7nm process. This would likely be PAINFUL for the short term on Intel\'s books (stock price may like it, not sure) as they have to take a massive writedown of lost invesment. But it is an option. It\'s not like AMD is beating Intel in manufacturing, TSMC is. TSMC would jump at a deal that causes Intel to abandon next gen fabs as long as the contract was air tight and Intel can\'t just just TSMC short term and abandon them once Intel catches up. \n\n**Actual CPU Tech**\n\nIt\'s interesting how far Intel has been able to push 14nm. If their next CPU in march can take back the crown for single core king it means that we have a 14nm CPU versus a 7nm CPU beating single core. Even if it doesn\'t it\'s still interesting they can be so close.\n\nWhat this highlights is Intel\'s manufacturing problems, not a base CPU design problem. If Intel solves its 7nm problem, and their 14nm can at least be competitive in some cases. Then AMD should actually worry a little bit that they only have a few years window where they\'re on top. If Intel had been using TSMC all along they\'d be on top for sure right now (though much lower margins).\n\nAlso Intel\'s behind not due to dragging its feet but rather for trying a VERY risky method of getting to 10nm and 7nm that is way better than TSMC\'s. However everyone said it couldn\'t be done and... well... maybe they were right.  Intel likely was overconfident and took too large a risk. Everyone is calling them a dinosaur and not investing and not innovating. But the reality is sometimes innovation is risky, and Intel took a risk and lost. That\'s NOT good for a company but it\'s not an indication of lack of innovation.\n\nFor everyone that thinks Intel can\'t innovate just remember one thing: Intel **invented** the process TSMC uses, just that they decided to use something else. Intel actually owns the patents and IP for AMD\'s x86 CPU design AND TSMC\'s manufacturing process. That doesn\'t sound like a lack of innovation to me, just sounds like terrible execution.\n\n**Future Investment and Bright spots**\n\nIntel\'s not just all CPU either and that\'s key. Intel will be releasing their first standalone GPU very soon and it\'s rumored to be extremely efficient (aka good for laptops). Later next year their will release their first gaming GPU that\'s targeted to be better than a 3070, and while I\'d take it with a grain of salt that it actually will be better it\'s still very interesting. Also these GPUs will be 6nm courtesy of TSMC. There\'s no way it doesn\'t take a few years for Intel\'s GPUs to catch up but there\'s an opportunity to open an extremely large new line of revenue here and compete more directly with Nvidia. I think it\'s very likely Intel will be able to beat Radeon on GPUs but Nvidia is a bit harder to match.\n\nMobileye by itself would likely be one of those 500PE companies that everyone is nutting over on wallstreetbets. But it\'s part of Intel so few really care about it. They have some of the best automating driving tech  in the world and will be what NIO uses. Also Tesla used to use them and basically took all their ideas and in housed it. Tesla did not actually have all the best answers for automated driving, Mobileye did and they copied it. Mobileye is very possible a huge win by itself.\n\nR&amp;D as a whole, Intel spends more on R&amp;D than all of AMD\'s revenue. The next big breakthroughs, just like the last big breakthroughs will happen because of Intel. Whether Intel takes advantage is another issue but they have massive investments in far out there R&amp;D. \n\n**TL;DR;**\n\nIt\'s cops vs robbers. NVIDIA/AMD need to execute perfectly going forward to justify their prices. Intel only needs a single win. If Intel gets a GPU out that can match Nvidia? Win. Intel fixes their manufacturing? Win. Mobileye explodes in growth? Win.\n\nAll the above is only a bull case because of relative valuations. I do believe as time goes on AMD will grow and take market share from Intel. That\'s a given. But what\'s not a given is that both AMD and Intel can\'t grow going into the future. Intel\'s prices so low it doesn\'t need to actually keep market share, just be able to expand into a larger market.', ""The problem is that's not true. AMD is doing the Nvidia move to Intel. Threadripper has gone completely unanswered for years just like how Nvidia 80 and 80Ti cards + Titan haven't had an AMD equivalent for several generations.\n\nIntel has nothing and their next node looks like a disaster"", 'The prices are low for realistic calls and the funds keep going up!

I remember listening to Buffet and him saying that he doesn't invest in anything that he doesn't understand the business of and how it's going to make profit, and he doesn't invest in anything that he doesn't think he'll get paid his money back in dividends in some window of time. I just don't think you can consistently beat the market to the extent he did without nailing it on some growth stock and getting ahead of the curve on some emerging technologies, that's stuff that you can't do by just analyzing fundamentals like Buffet emphasizes. \n\nThe antithesis of that approach is probably Masayoshi Son who bets on every high-growth, potentially disruptive technology pitch that he hears and gets burned pretty often. But he also hit the nail on the head with Alibaba when the business model wasn't something that a conventional investor would have even considered in the wake of the dotcom bubble. Then he was supposedly a coinflip away from buying Nvidia instead of Arm 5 years ago and if he did the value of Softbank today would likely be more than Berkshire Hathaway and he's still 25 years younger than Buffet. \n\nMoving forward I think it'll always be a balancing act to beat the market. Young high risk investors will prefer the high growth potential, older people and those with more wealth will prefer the dividends and fundamentals. Buffet's discipline is a huge asset but a more modern eye towards technology, growth, and disruption is going to be necessary to beat the market for the next 30 years."", ""The Taiwanese triangle of doom rules semi's, TSMC Nvidia AMD, big upside still I think going forward.\n\nThanks for the write-up once again!"", 'Noooooo, they are going to slowly die by Nvidia (this includes ARM), AMD, Xilinx, and TSMC']"

There are loads of companies out there that make equally good components.\n\n\\- The margin on many PC components is small.\n\n\\- How will they continue to grow in the future is an argument made by some. I think this is a very valid point. How much can a computer fan, AiO cooler or PSU change or improve in the future? The reality is not much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bull cases**\n\n\\- They are number 1 in sales for PC cases, performance RAM, PSUs, AiO CPU coolers, fans, and number 2/3 for many other components such as keyboards and mice. This is set to continue, Corsair are a very popular brand amongst gamers for their quality, reliability and reasonable cost.\n\n\\- The stock is slightly undervalued right now.\n\n\\- Nvidia and AMD have just released very power thirsty GPUs. Many games will need to upgrade their PSU (possibly more components), so Corsair are likely to capitalise on this. LOTS of gamers skipped the Nvidia 20xx series altogether and held onto their 1080Ti GPUs as they didn't see value in upgrading. So now the 30xx series it out they all need to upgrade their old, underpowered PSUs to run a 30xx card.\n\n\\- Corsair squired EpocCam recently. An acquisition which can help them increase their foothold in the gaming streamer market, expanding their customer base. We've already seen this with the aquisition of Elgato in 2018 which produces capture cards and other peripherals Corsair didn't sell like streaming microphones, LED lights, the StreamDeck and more. EpocCam will sit within the Elgato brand.\n\n\\- Not that long ago Corsair began to offer custom-designed liquid cooling systems. You can go onto their website and essentially build a bespoke system for your rig. They also sell pre-built rigs and I can see them expanding this sector as well. This is targeting a new customer base - gamers who want to buy a gaming rig but don't want to built it themselves.\n\n\\- With increased lockdowns during the pandemic, Corsair will do well from this. Gamers will be at home more, spending more on their rigs on upgrades etc which will increase Corsair's revenue. With holiday season nearly here this will only strengthen Corsair's position."", ""One thing to note is that Nvidia and AMD's new lineup of graphics cards are power hungry - more so than previous generations of cards.

Corsair was likely my most risky investment that\'s why I left quickly.

I\'m putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I\'d recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they\'ll be great for the long term. If you don\'t have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn\'t too bad actually).

Did we just become best friends?! I posted something similar. I guess great minds think alike.\n\nI agree with everything you are saying but I'll add this. I believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, Nintendo rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales.\n\nWith every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero. Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time. Going forward I predict they will create 3 lines of devices that will reach a broad line of customers while maintaining the incremental updates. Switch Lite, Switch, and the upcoming Switch Pro.\n\nThat kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Like the smartphone, new versions of the Switch could be backwards-compatible with all games released so far while becoming more powerful and feature-rich. They have used Nvidia's arm chips to ensure their software (games) will always work with every Switch that comes out. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem on top of its exclusive first-party titles while making profits and sales more predictable."", ""Rule number one of reddit is don't listen to a single thing anyone here says.

Not to mention pinning their CPUs thermal limits while AMD innovated and this year became the market leader in desktop CPU performance (especially gaming).\n\nMy take: AMD and especially NVDA are overvalued. INTC is under valued (apparently ~40%), and is probably getting much less investor eyes b/c they are now a mature “me too” company. No longer an innovator or market leader, with less future growth potential.\n\nThis is paired with AMD and NVDA notably becoming “darlings” in the tech world. Even with a fraction of the earnings AMD was toping out 2x INTC price this year.', 'No reason just a good ole switcheroo rotating into other sectors.

I particularly like AMD's acquisition of XNLX. Combined with its price dip a week or three ago, I decided that justified opening a position. Comparing them to MSFT in terms of ten-year potential seems way off base to me though, because I think it severely understates what MSFT did. MSFT was an absolute game changer more than 30 years ago, and used its unique position to evolve into a very central platform for businesses and government. I don't see NVDA or AMD expanding their footprint like that, considering the industry's number and quality of formidable competitors. \n\nI hate that PINS still has a negative operating income after all this time, without a clear and meaningful trend toward the positive. That doesn't make it a bad investment, it just makes it one I don't understand. \n\nI like clean energy still. I went with PBW over ICLN, but should be a solid long-term hold. No telling how the sector will develop over the next 3 to 18 months, so there's certain risk for some significant drops, but if you're holding long-term and have the risk tolerance, certainly a solid play. \n\nSBE cons: brand new, negative operating income, doesn't appear to have a footprint in China, the most imminent growth market in the EV space. Pros: obviously making a play to be at the center of a growing market. If EVs are truly going to take off, the supporting infrastructure MUST be there.

Here are the prices they paid per share:\n\n* Lot 1: August 3: $440\n* Lot 2: September 1: $580\n* Lot 3: October 1: $540\n* Lot 4: November 2: $500\n* Average: $515\n\nNow, Christmas is coming up and they realize they need about $500 to pay for some gifts. NVDA closed at $523 Friday so they figure they can sell a share tomorrow for around $520. Here are their capital gains which taxes will be based on:\n\n* Lot 1: August 3: $520 - $440 = $80\n* Lot 2: September 1: $520 - $580 = -$60 (a loss!)\n* Lot 3: October 1: $520 - $540 = -$20 (a loss!)\n* Lot 4: November 2: $520 - $500 = $20\n\nLot 1 would be selected using the FIFO method that most brokerages use as default, so they'd be on the hook at tax time for $80 added to their taxable income for the year, so let's say \\~$20 at the 24% bracket. \n\nHad they instead instructed their broker to sell from Lot 2, they would've realized a $60 loss instead, which at tax time can be used for offsetting capital gains or deducting from regular income. That means selling from Lot 2 has effectively lowered their tax bill \\~$15 at the 24% bracket. \n\nPaying $20 versus getting $15 back might not seem huge, but obviously this adds up over a lifetime of investing. Also, even when you get into long-term gains treatment, older shares tend to be the ones you purchased more cheaply, making the FIFO method even worse. A long-term NVDA investor would likely not want the FIFO method to pick out shares from 5+ years ago when NVDA was around $20 meaning $500 in capital gains if they had more recent lots with more favorable implications. \n\nWorth pointing out that the OP seems to have wanted to sell the share with the lower cost basis, which would make sense in the opposite situation from the NVDA example i.e. their income was low enough this year that taking more capital gains by selling the lower cost basis share is a good thing.

However INTC is cheap because they are losing in tech, getting their lunch ate, losing market share, and getting attacked from all sides by AMD/Nvidia/Apple/TSMC/etc\n\nLike some others have echoed in this thread and previous ones discussing INTC. The problem isn't with the company's brand, sector, or books. It's Bob Swan &amp; upper management. When you hire CFO &amp; corporate goons who climb to the top via connections, corporate political maneuvering, and NOT tech, then you end up with a company that's corporate: \n\n* Q2 INTC shits the bed on delivering the 7nm and manufacturing problems. But instead of addressing the manufacturing problems or the delivering the 7nm. Bob Swan goes on to CNBC to shill his corporate talk pitch and then decides to use company funds to ~~invest in engineers/facilities to resolve the 7nm tech &amp; manufacturing problems~~ ***DO SHARE BUY BACKS*** like the CFO corporate goon he is.\n\n* Q3 Instead of delivering news on 7nm when apple and other are moving to 5nm chips already Intel puts out stupid ass jargon and shitty as in-house tests and meme architecture/software tweaks that are supposed produce more or work better with AI, but in reality does very little and doesn't fix the problem that they are falling behind. Exactly what you expect from some biz/socsci major who doesn't know tech.\n\n* Q2/Q3 concerns also included the indecisiveness of in house or out sourced manufacturing. This is literally low hanging fruit for corporate goons who are good with words. Yet he couldn't even deliver on that. Just gave some vague words about how they'll decide in the future.\n\nProblem with INTC isn't that the top brass aren't tech guys, but that they are corporate ladder biz/finance guys who don't run a tech company like a tech company. If they were smart biz guys and invested funds back into the engineers then this shit wouldn't happen. \n\nThat's why INTC isn't a likely target for Berkshire. I would be thrilled if it was, but it isn't because BRK &amp; Buffett aren't Icahn Enterprises &amp; Carl. They don't jump in, start demanding shit, and try to mix things up for the quick ST profit. They like buying good companies and holding for LT value growth. BRK already had a big stake in WFC and they didn't even try to change that company and decided to sell at the bottom to buy BAC instead.\n\nTL;DR BRK ain't going into INTC because Buffett isn't Icahn.

They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it’s easy from there; what task isn’t tough at first?It’s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it’s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won’t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don’t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn’t or personal info doesn’t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.

Many other startups don’t have the scale, the promising ones like Rigetti or Xanadu will probably be bought over by big companies in the near future. It’s not priced in yet, the long term horizon is about 10-15 yrs before they take over the profit calculations.

But google is more aggressive over the intermediate term, so if your investment horizon is &lt;25 yrs, probably alphabet is a better investment.

And that is something to probably stick with. Diversity is good too I think.\n\nI did consider a partially bot/human directed account for GICs and Mutual funds etc but I decided out last minute for now. I think with my learning and mistakes over the last year of trading has really opened my eyes, I am self directed currently. I started by messing around with penny stocks and realized 90% of those guys kinda didn't know what they were doing (including myself) and hoping to strike it rich at the lottery the usual snake oil pitches on reddit and other trash website articles.\n\nAnyway, then i started thinking about the companies I liked and were popular so I narrowed it down to blue chips even though I could only get a few for a while and had no idea about anything other than the companies were good  cause they made cool stuff that everyone wanted. I was only holding AMD and NVDA for a while and that got me kind of the jump start i needed, wish I still had some they are actually great companies for growth.\n\nAfter that I picked up on some BS mining stocks and other pump and dumps that burned me lol because I didnt know what researching stocks the economy and literally taking into consideration all the things that can even if really weird effect the markets. which now I can pretty much smell, but i sometimes take a gamble on one now and then to see if i can reach a profit taking point for a day or week. I think what a lot of people find hard is taking some profit and even reinvest in other growth things and then save some side money for messing around. That is literally how you make money trading, patiently and wisely....its actually lengthy stuff but it keeps my mind off my other life issues.\n\nSo I jumped on the EV China stuff right before it really took of a few months back...i think even after they dropped down from 70-90% i made my 30-50% and jumped ship on the majority of what i initially held. I still think its got some more juice in it yet. I did some dabbling in some smaller companies dealing with semiconductors, nano tech advancements, biomedical, but I like the idea that a decent time to take at least a bit of profit is around the 20-25% mark and just flip it, not all of it necessarily but enough that you get a win and just cycle it through something else. I dumped over half of what I had. Which id say its something I at least I did well on. And you cant not take it as a win even though I am down a bunch since I started I am definitely still in the game.\n\nI really like the innovation companies and the green stocks are good too. But I think hands down fads (not pumps) sometimes due to legit catalysts (not pumps) make the most money the quickest. Looking at you Tesla. But to kinda end the rant I really think the ETFs sectors and most things involving the EV/Green, save the planet type stuff is huge and will likely have a ton of return going forth they a lot of them are totally growth stocks at this point. Then there are the staples like Walmart, Shopify Home Depot (things people need and want always go up eventually), and then of course you got your FAANGs.  But ya lately I have been looking at main stays and older blue chips that have new life breathed into them such as Disney and Intel and Microsoft...even BlackBerry is making a bit comeback Lol. So i think I accept the fact I had losses cause I have talked to so many great people and learned so much about what to do and how to do it and still am always researching and doin the whole DD thing. Oh and I think ethics for me is a big thing sometimes with companies. Like if there is a major scandal or the ceos are complete assholes to everyone i tend to not go near the stocks regardless if I 100% know they will make money because I just feel like a whore.

By that line of reasoning, it should have happened already, but it hasn\'t. Apples move will hasten the thing you think is going to happen anyway, but hasn\'t. \n\n&gt;it\'s been a rough path so far (Qualcomm\'s efforts have been laughable at best)\n\nBecause there has been no real impetus to do it, until now. \n\n&gt;This could change and that could make them a huge player in the chip business. \n\nIt\'s not going to change, and I\'m not arguing it will, so I\'ll ignore this line of argument. \n\n&gt;ARM (especially under NVIDIA) could release a new spec/core design that gets close to Apple. That will help the industry catch up to Apple, but I don\'t see it making any groundbreaking changes\n\nYes, that can and will probably happen. If Nvidia simply ""catch up to Apple"" it IS ground breaking when comparing it to Intel. That\'s the whole point. The power consumption, the performance and the battery life from Apple\'s chips are absolutely ground breaking vs Intel already. Once others follow suit, as they were going to do anyway according to you, the industry will indeed shift away from Intel chips. \n\n&gt;Like, I get the performance per watt the M1 brings to the table, but it\'s going to be silo\'d under the Apple umbrella.\n\nYes, and that doesn\'t matter. ARM chips exist outside the Apple umbrella. Dell, HP, etc will need Windows running those chips to sell PC\'s that are comparable to Apple\'s. \n\n&gt;You\'re not going to have the PC industry switch from Windows to macOS just because of this chip (or any desktop chips they release in their own dedicated hardware)\n\nYes, you absolutely will. Many enterprise environments run software that is already available on both platforms. When it comes time to purchase new machines, as I pointed out to you with the 10\'s of thousands of laptops my University buys every single year, the OS simply doesn\'t matter. The vast majority use software that is available on both platforms already, or they do everything in a web browser. \n\nYou don\'t think Dell or HP or Acer are going to want to produce Windows laptops that can get the kind of battery life that a Mac can? If I am right about places like I work switching their fleets to Apple, Dell is absolutely going to notice that and try to fight it. They cannot fight 25-50% battery gains in a competing product by staying on Intel. They\'ll start to put pressure on Microsoft and Quallcomm and probably Nvidia and Samsung to provide to them a chip and OS that can compete. \n\n&gt;This isn\'t even taking into consideration how much of the gaming market is intel\'s. and how much of the server space market is intel\'s (where the big margins come from in the first place)\n\nI\'ve already addressed the server market. Those servers all sit in data centers. The number one cost of a data center is power, and it\'s not even close. Amazon already uses ARM in it\'s data centers for this very reason. ARM is without a doubt going to take over data centers as well, and before that happens, I am already seeing first hand how AMD is moving Intel out of the server space. \n\n&gt;I\'m not trying to discount what Apple has done here. In their first release of the M1 they\'ve matched and in some cases outperformed veterans in the industry\n\nYou could have typed this sentence in 2017 and replaced ""Apple"" with ""AMD"" and ""M1"" with ""Ryzen"". \n\n&gt;But this is Apple we\'re talking about. this shift made in the latest announcement will be great for apple shareholders. \n\nYes, this is Apple. The same Apple that routinely releases products that completely change the entire industry because everyone else ends up playing catch up. That\'s what is happening here. \n\n&gt;but it isn\'t going to be that much of a hit to intel\'s revenue imo\n\nOn that point you may be right, but it\'s not a point I argued against. How much money Intel makes will depend entirely on how Intel responds. The game is certainly not over. Intel could release it\'s own ARM chip, if it wanted. My only point to you has been that what Apple has done will cause a seismic shift in the industry, and that is going to happen. And if it was going to happen anyway, as you seem to think, then this will only make it happen faster. Perhaps that doesn\'t mean the end of Intel, but it very likely is the beginning of the end for the dominance of the x86 architecture. Predicting exactly what that means for any given company would be a fools errand. Intel is not stupid and is a huge company with a lot of money. They can, and probably will, respond with something great at some point. But to pretend that you aren\'t standing on the edge of the entire industry shifting is just silly. When these shifts happen, it usually leaves behind some dead companies. I don\'t think that will be Intel, but it certainly could be.', 'I also have this TERRIBLE FOMO. But there are lots of stocks that fall in this. First off, take a huge deep breath because in the end this is ""all money"". I know money can make life easier but your FOMO is just about how you\'re perceiving your world having changed if you invested in TSLA.\n\nNext, sit down and reflect on the past. Think about how much you would have invested back in April given your mind set. Seriously, think about the realities of the situation. Stock market had crashed, COVID was raging, economic collapse was a real aura in the air. If you look at just the stock price and think about ""if I just yolo\'d my life savings in to TSLA then, I could retire now!"", there are infinite stocks you could have done this with.\n\nAlso, you stated you had a legitimate reason not to buy TSLA in April. Big question: What has changed between then and now? Do you all of a sudden like Elon as a CEO? Are you just sad you missed out on gains? Take this a big learning experience. Write down your behaviour and strategies, and refer to this self-created documentation before you make any moves in the future. Take emotion out of the game, and tweak your strategy/document as you learn more.\n\nWhen TSLA hit $1000 in June, that\'s when I finally had the conviction to say: ""Fuck it, I\'m getting in"". I put 10% of my portfolio into TSLA and made a strategy for myself:\n\n1. I would hold TSLA long term so price fluctuations wouldn\'t scare me.\n\n2. I did research and fundamentally believed that TSLA could go to $2000 within 3 years based on their upcoming product lines (ie. insurance product, power plant, batter augments, robo-taxi, etc).\n\n3. I created a buying strategy that I would buy whenever the price dropped a certain amount, or if it crossed certain resistance levels. I also realized TSLA moves on momentum, so I would buy immediately the morning of any news release. That included earnings, stock split, battery day, etc. And that strategy has worked really well for me.\n\nUsing these rules of order, I stopped trying to buy into TSLA with emotion and rather focused on fundamentals and market forces.\n\nIf I was getting into TSLA today, I would use the following strategies:\n\n1. I would only go in with a small amount, no more than 5% of my account out of fear of over valuation.\n\n2. If I had funds to go in with 100 shares, I would buy 100 shares and immediately buy near term puts to hedge against a heavy downswing. So you could buy 100 shares at $640 and then buy $600 Jan 15 puts to hedge against a heavy downsize. That would bring you peace of mind against an ""overvaluation"".\n\nAfter that, you could decide to sell covered calls to bring down your cost average if TSLA stabilizes, or just let it ride if it keeps running.\n\n\nBe very aware that TSLA as a company is surging right now mainly because of supply/demand economics. All fundamentals went out the window after TSLA announced the split and the stock surged 100% since then.\n\nAlso, be aware that LOTS of stocks in the past few years have gone up 500%. You didn\'t just miss out on TSLA, here is a list of companies:\n\n1. AMZN\n\n2. MSFT\n\n3. AAPL\n\n4. PAYC\n\n5. OKTA\n\n6. AMD (which is actually up 50x...)\n\n7. NVDA\n\n8. SHOP\n\n9. APPS\n\n10. CLSK\n\n11. ROKU\n\n12. SQ\n\nDo you have FOMO at not buying AAPL in 2016?

Good Job on his part.\n\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to invest in Intel however short term gains is not it. It\'s possible that they will be range bound for months between say 45-55 even if you think long-term they will do good. But that said here are my thoughts:\n\nMacroeconomic Trends\n\nThe stock market is nuts right now, AMD/Nvida ARE eating Intel\'s lunch but at the same time intel is immensely more profitable than both companies COMBINED. The valuations for both AMD/Nvidia assume they will grow immensely over the next decade and basically ""can\'t"" Mess up. Nvidia needs to be the undisputed king of GPU and AMD needs to basically eat half of Intel\'s market share just for TODAY\'s price to make sense. How do they grow from here? This is true of much the market, Zoom, Tesla, etc... There\'s a potential pop or at least stagnation coming for trendy companies. Short term it\'s hard to predict when the gravy train will end. But Intel has much less downside from these numbers than many companies (including Nvidia/AMD)\n\nThe Recent Drop\n\nIntel\'s government and datacenter sales dropped 37% this quarter. This is FOLLOWING 30% increases for two quarters. What likely happened is as covid hit governments and enterprises massively bought up new servers to service the WFH world and now that covid is unwinding combined with a really rough economic environment (unemployment, slowing of economy, etc...) those entities are ""good"" with their current server capacity since their recent upgrades. For the year these sales are still up.\n\nIt\'s important to note these numbers do NOT include cloud sales. Cloud sales were up 15% this quarter. Is 15% good? I don\'t actually know because if the market grew by say 50% it\'s possible intel got 15% and AMD got the rest. That said Intel\'s PE ratio is so low this is fine, and AMD\'s is so high that this MUST be true. Also a cloud CPU is likely more efficient than an enterprise one as many players share it in VMs and such. Meaning if every single government/enterprise datacenter moved to the cloud it\'s very likely Intel would sell less CPUs is overall demand stayed static.\n\nAll in all this is to say the recent drop seems a bit of an overreaction, it\'s not great news but also not terrible and unpredicted.\n\nManufacturing Woes\n\nThis is the big one. Constant delays of 10nm, 7nm. Currently 10nm is subpar in yields. That said their newest fab just came online allowing them to sell more 10nm. Next year they will be releasing their first desktop 10nm CPU (after one final hurrah of 14nm...). This means Intel is very behind TSMC on manufacturing capabilities. That said until this latest AMD CPU Intel wasn\'t actually that far behind for many applications. It was the single core king, and may still be for non consumer, but we don\'t know yet. This means despite AMD having all of TSMC\'s manufacturing prowess it\'s unable to significantly pull ahead of Intel. We\'re not talking an order of magnitude, AMD is better by a manageable percent. This means when intel figures it out and gets their act together their CPU designs will very likely be able to beat AMD\'s.\n\nNext is the possibility of abandoning their fabs to use TSMC - Intel could strike a deal to kill their 7nm process. This would likely be PAINFUL for the short term on Intel\'s books (stock price may like it, not sure) as they have to take a massive writedown of lost invesment. But it is an option. It\'s not like AMD is beating Intel in manufacturing, TSMC is. TSMC would jump at a deal that causes Intel to abandon next gen fabs as long as the contract was air tight and Intel can\'t just just TSMC short term and abandon them once Intel catches up.\n\nActual CPU Tech\n\nIt\'s interesting how far Intel has been able to push 14nm. If their next CPU in march can take back the crown for single core king it means that we have a 14nm CPU versus a 7nm CPU beating single core. Even if it doesn\'t it\'s still interesting they can be so close.\n\nWhat this highlights is Intel\'s manufacturing problems, not a base CPU design problem. If Intel solves its 7nm problem, and their 14nm can at least be competitive in some cases. Then AMD should actually worry a little bit that they only have a few years window where they\'re on top. If Intel had been using TSMC all along they\'d be on top for sure right now (though much lower margins).\n\nAlso Intel\'s behind not due to dragging its feet but rather for trying a VERY risky method of getting to 10nm and 7nm that is way better than TSMC\'s. However everyone said it couldn\'t be done and... well... maybe they were right. Intel likely was overconfident and took too large a risk. Everyone is calling them a dinosaur and not investing and not innovating. But the reality is sometimes innovation is risky, and Intel took a risk and lost. That\'s NOT good for a company but it\'s not an indication of lack of innovation.\n\nFor everyone that thinks Intel can\'t innovate just remember one thing: Intel invented the process TSMC uses, just that they decided to use something else. Intel actually owns the patents and IP for AMD\'s x86 CPU design AND TSMC\'s manufacturing process. That doesn\'t sound like a lack of innovation to me, just sounds like terrible execution.\n\nFuture Investment and Bright spots\n\nIntel\'s not just all CPU either and that\'s key. Intel will be releasing their first standalone GPU very soon and it\'s rumored to be extremely efficient (aka good for laptops). Later next year their will release their first gaming GPU that\'s targeted to be better than a 3070, and while I\'d take it with a grain of salt that it actually will be better it\'s still very interesting. Also these GPUs will be 6nm courtesy of TSMC. There\'s no way it doesn\'t take a few years for Intel\'s GPUs to catch up but there\'s an opportunity to open an extremely large new line of revenue here and compete more directly with Nvidia. I think it\'s very likely Intel will be able to beat Radeon on GPUs but Nvidia is a bit harder to match.\n\nMobileye by itself would likely be one of those 500PE companies that everyone is nutting over on wallstreetbets. But it\'s part of Intel so few really care about it. They have some of the best automating driving tech in the world and will be what NIO uses. Also Tesla used to use them and basically took all their ideas and in housed it. Tesla did not actually have all the best answers for automated driving, Mobileye did and they copied it. Mobileye is very possible a huge win by itself.\n\nR&amp;D as a whole, Intel spends more on R&amp;D than all of AMD\'s revenue. The next big breakthroughs, just like the last big breakthroughs will happen because of Intel. Whether Intel takes advantage is another issue but they have massive investments in far out there R&amp;D.\n\nTL;DR;\n\nIt\'s cops vs robbers. NVIDIA/AMD need to execute perfectly going forward to justify their prices. Intel only needs a single win. If Intel gets a GPU out that can match Nvidia? Win. Intel fixes their manufacturing? Win. Mobileye explodes in growth? Win.\n\nAll the above is only a bull case because of relative valuations. I do believe as time goes on AMD will grow and take market share from Intel. That\'s a given. But what\'s not a given is that both AMD and Intel can\'t grow going into the future. Intel\'s prices so low it doesn\'t need to actually keep market share, just be able to expand into a larger market.', 'Nvidia (Just for disclosure purposes I own AMD) - because few players and good technology.', 'Nvidia,\n\nWould also add SE and MSFT', 'Fundamentals are a tiny part of an investment decision these days. I work for a major fund as an Analyst and yes, the numbers matter, but you gotta be 1) out of consensus on something in your thesis 2) really have a talent at feeling out a narrative / sentiment shift. 3) understand the positioning that exists in the market. I was at a conference last year and there was a study presented where if you knew with perfect foresight exactly which companies would beat consensus and which ones wouldn’t and went long the beats and short the misses - you’d make 0.4% alpha. \n\nWhat has really helped me make some good investment calls is nailing the high level directionally, having a firm understanding of the narrative for companies in the market and think about the durability of that narrative / risks to it. \n\nRemember Apple was expensive at 15x because it was a hardware company and now it’s cheap at 35x as a software and services company. That might be frustrating to some of you, but you will do better not fighting what the tape is telling you, you’ll give up far more money waiting for the golden opportunity than getting in early on a shift in narrative and riding it. \n\nTesla is overvalued because it is the ultimate story stock. It is disrupting a trillion dollar TAM with an incredible product. This could be like when the fucking iPhone came out.

In this case Toyota is the mine and QS is the pick axe.\nThe bigger concern is Solid Power out of CO.

Their stock value has increased several times over as a result. They\'ve also recently released the AMD 5000 series Ryzen CPUs which are significant upgrades to the 3000 series.  \n  \nAs a result, both of these companies have achieved high rates of growth and profitability.  \n  \nPeople staying at home building computers and playing video games to use in order to stay sane will raise revenues, which raise profits, which raise equity, which potentially raises stock value, assuming nothing else swoops in and scares off investors.

I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice.  I looked at your portfolio - love your enthusiasm for so many companies!   \n\nFirst, watch this video from Adam Khoo (don't take his $1000 investor course, he has plenty of free videos you can watch - no need to pay money for any of this stuff!): [https://youtu.be/dzHTnU1Wjlo](https://youtu.be/dzHTnU1Wjlo)\n\nThe list below is what I would do.  Where I didn't make any notes, I either don't know enough about the stock or I wouldn't buy it - regardless, ones where I didn't make notes, it's not in my own portfolio.  The other thing you might consider is investing in an ETF since you seem to love so many companies.  I have positions in $VOO and $ARKK.  I love all the ARK ETFS (read up on Catherine Wood of ARK).  $VOO is a blue chip ETF, you can just invest and forget about it.  If you don't know what an ETF is, it's an 'exchange traded fund' created to mimic an index.  So $VOO is modeled on the S&amp;P 500's growth, which is \\~8% every year.  So with $VOO, you can expect to make about 8% gains each year.  ARK is the same, but Cathie Wood is a genius and $ARKK made over 164% gains this year.  This year was unprecedented for the stock market though.\n\nAlso, I have looked at financial wizards that I admire - Cathie Wood, Warren Buffett - and I see what holdings their ETFs have and research them.\n\nHere's what I thought of your list - again, you have to decide what you want and what your goals are as an investor.  I personally don't like having more than 10-12 stocks in my portfolio, including ETFs, so I would pick 12 stocks here and make a plan to sell the rest (hopefully at a profit or breaking even).

INTC has insane cash flow, which can be used for RnD, acquisitions, and returning value to shareholders. They're current research budget is greater than NVDA and AMD whole revenue.

If you really know the industry and how it ebbs and flows then I say go for it. It\'s an aggressive move but that\'s how these stocks are. I myself got just 50 shares of it just to see how it goes. My understanding is this:\n\nCD projekt RED has tons of fans. Witcher 3 was insane and more insane 5 years later when the show came out and brought back life to that series. Cyberpunk was expected to be an insane release just like that but I know how that company runs so I figured ""yeah it would be great for pc!"" Sadly I was right in that way where the consoles really REALLY underperformed and they took a big big trust hit from their fans and employees.\n\nThe thing is, it\'s all an echo chamber. Yes the game got removed (most likely because they admitted it themselves and offered refunds) and yes console players aren\'t happy. That\'s a huge audience. But when you look at the numbers of who bought it, the biggest purchase was from the PC community. Over half!\n\nWith the news coming out that they sold 13 million AFTER refunds a couple of days ago thats when I jumped in. I know they will fix it in the long run, I know they have free DLC and expansions (if they match the witcher then everyone is going to be hyped). The media reports mostly perspectives from twitter or online where again we are in this prime echo chamber where we think everyone hates it and the company will fail.\n\nAll I know is that the game sold amazingly well. Even after the controversy, they will still make a profit. So now it\'s just a waiting game for it to go back up. It could take some years but I can see it only going up. They aren\'t going to disappear. I myself love the game\'s narrative and atmosphere and it has tech in it that will last a while. \n\nFor reference, I bought nintendo stock before the switch came out based on lots of rumors, how the system would be, etc etc. Got it at 25 and now its around 80. AMD as well. I bought that at 12 and now its 93 only because I knew that nintendo was using Nvidia and the consoles were using amd. I bet against myself as a fail safe like playing craps and ended up being incredibly surprised that amd just took over. Bought more of amd later too because of rumors about intel sucking and apple making their own chip. Nintendo I\'m sticking with after the release of mario land and maybe if a switch pro comes out thats where I\'ll have to watch closely to either dip out or not. Its great to look back at their history too and see how their charts flow. Like for nintendo the Wii was their highest era for worth then the wiiu happened and it crashed. It\'s so close to being back to the wii era but with everything in life it will fall back down once again since game stock....or even tech stock is like that! \n\nSo my advice is, yeah buy if you feel comfortable. Watch it, read the news about the company and when you feel the curve reached the highest it could, sell and wait for the company to fall again because they ALL do at some point. Its like a weird 12 year cycle I\'m noticing. \n\nI hope this helps even though I rambled! I\'ve just been doing this for 4ish years with tech and game stock and it\'s more of a feeling and keeping up with the industry more than anything. It\'s fun! Except when I sold snapchat and then magically it exploded.... grrrr...
