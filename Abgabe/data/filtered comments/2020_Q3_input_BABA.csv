Consumer discretionary has surged entirely on the backs of it\'s largest 3 stocks, AMZN, TSLA, and BABA.

AAPL and MSFT are probably fine even though they\'re overvalued, they\'re not going anywhere. MSFT is a cash cow and AAPL will always be AAPL. PRMTX is &gt;15% AMZN which is massive on a stock that is completely parabolic on a monthly basis right now, but there is a legit reason to believe AMZN is still undervalued I think and your position on PRMTX isn\'t that big. TSLA is the obvious one to unload a little of IMO.\n\nIf this were my portfolio, I would size down TSLA and possibly size down a few % on AAPL and MSFT just cause they are your next biggest positions. Roll the gains into PRMTX to even out the balance and bet more on AMZN continuing to dominate the world. \n\nI\'d also roll some of the profits into the stuff that you believe is undervalued based on COVID-19 like JBLU and CCL if you think they are going to recover long term.\n\nIMO bottom line here is you are way outta balance in the portfolio as a whole and way too lopsided in tech.

Was up a bit and then tanked by 40-45% the coming months.. but I kept it to date and see where it is now. Buy and hold. What you want to do is day trading which is gambling.', 'I\'m not per se. I hold all of ARKW/F/G/K with heavier weighting toward K. The reasoning for this is I feel as though K has a lot of room to really explode as it is really speculative. Thats similar to WCLD and SKYY, in my opinion. I\'m going to do a lot of writing about the subject but the TLDR is: buy them all. They\'re all uniquely positioned and have very different holdings. The ARK funds are huge spec plays that I really believe in, while WCLD/SKYY/CLOU are all cloud computing ETFs with really diversified holdings I also believe in. \n\nARKW is the next gen internet ARK fund which sounds really speculative but it really just holds Tesla, Square, FB, Roku &amp; Splunk, among others. Compared to WCLD which holds NET, FSLY, SHOP, TWLO, COUP, ZM, DDOG, etc. If you just compare the two holdings and let SHOP &amp; TESLA both cancel each other out (huge run ups the last few months) - I consider NET, FSLY (huge boom recently), TWLO, COUP, ZM (Obviously huge boom), DDOG, COUP, Etcetera to have WAY more room to grow than Roku, Square (which I consider overvalued personally), Zillow, pinterest, etcetera. Basically, WCLD is just much more future-focused, in my opinion. NET, FSLY, DDOG and TWLO alone are going to be monsters. \n\nCLOU, on the other hand, I consider much closer to ARKW in growth potential. Their holdings to me are largely slow &amp; steady, whereas WCLD has potential to absolutely jet. \n\nI personally really like SKYY as well. Its basically a mini QQQ it has a TON of bluechips. BABA, AMZN, MSFT, SHOP, ORCL, &amp; GOOGL - not to mention FSLY. If you want slow and steady, hold for years - I think this is your play. \n\nNow comparing the three, SKYY has a 0.6% E/R, while CLOU is 0.68%, and WCLD is 0.45%. The ARK funds are all around 0.75% E/R which is significantly higher than WCLD. So again it comes down to your belief in the individual holdings of each ETF. I have all 3 and I weight WCLD and SKYY higher than CLOU because I believe in their holdings more. \n\nThe ARK funds are all very very different. I know each pretty much all holds 10% TSLA but beyond that they\'re much more specific sector ETFs, and I think worthwhile to hold all of them. ARKW is the next gen internet, while G is genomic revolution (heavy biotech spec plays and like 97% of its holding are in \'Healthcare\'). Where this differs from traditional biotech plays, is that it is banking on genomic healthcare as the wave of the future - and I agree. In a similar sense, the ARKQ is the same but for robotics and autonomous tech. If you look at why TSLA is so booming compared to other EVs, one of the main reasons is their huge advancements in autonomous vehicles. Especially in the wake of Covid, we can easily chart point A to B of autonomous tech and robotics taking over as the future of retail. AMZN is pushing hard on that front, which should tell you just about everything you need to know about ARKQ\'s value. ARKF is the fintech etf, basically banking on online retail and money management. Obviously they hold SQ, but they also hold APPL, PDD (huge runner, imo), MELI (gigantic), TCEHY (huge), and PYPL. Again, under the ""new normal"" its very easy to see the value of fintech. There\'s a reason ARKF, ARKQ, and ARKG have all run up massively since the covid dip. \n\nThen there\'s ARKK which is their \'innovation\' fund. Its heavily diversified - much more than the others, and sort of is a \'best of\' their other funds. If you have to pick one ETF I would recommend this one. \n\nNow all that is to say: ARKW is okay but maybe consider these other options instead. Of the listed ETFs I would rank it second to last just above CLOU.', ""This happened during the SARS epidemic in China. Alibaba took off during that episode. So I wouldn't say no one saw that coming.

Delivery from those is quick, particularly if it\'s local, and delivery is cheap. Either free or $1-2.\n\nA lot of it is stuff drop shipped from China.

I have got stuff next day if I buy from a local seller, and it\'s rarely longer than a few days.\n\nIf I am willing to wait, I usually buy from from AliExpress. Delivery is free, prices are lower and no import tax. But it takes forever. Lazada, it is worth noting, is owned by Alibaba, but it is run differently and has maybe more customer service and certainly localisation. For example, it\'s trivial to return stuff to Lazada, you have to decide pretty quick and do it within 7 days but there are a lot of options for doing it, you can drop the package off at any 7/11 etc. So they make stuff like that easy- while AliExpress it\'s ""good luck"".\n\nI only very very rarely buy stuff from Amazon US, only if it is something that isn\'t sold locally. When you factor in the shipping and import taxes, the price can be double the US retail and it really makes no sense. I don\'t think many people in SE Asia shop from Amazon. Maybe more do in Singapore, Singapore is rich but it\'s also under 1% of ASEAN\'s population.\n\nLazada I think probably has a slightly better reputation and has done more to root out fakes, etc. compared with Shoppee. But Shoppee is often a little cheaper, and I haven\'t personally had an issue with anything I have bought there. I do also buy stuff directly from other local sellers, speciality retails or manufacturers, like I bought my laptop directly from Lenovo, but in terms of broad marketplaces, for me it really is Lazada, Shopee and AliExpress. I have bought a few things on eBay I couldn\'t find locally, I use that more than Amazon. eBay isn\'t 100% US focus, like you will get sellers from Taiwan on eBay that do free shipping to Thailand. Amazon is laser-focused on the US (or on the other sites, the other specific countries they serve) and shipping anywhere else (plus the taxes) is usually extortionate, it just makes no sense here, honestly.\n\nAmazon could make a push internationally in a major way, I have often wondered why exactly they haven\'t. Huge brand recognition, even in countries they don\'t operate in, they could do it and they could even do most of it remotely with a ""light"" or even no presence in many countries- like AliExpress does. But they\'d need to do free global shipping, which they don\'t. I do understand the issues around that and the postal rates and how China manages it, but it\'s not just China, Taiwanese sellers manage it as well, Hong Kong sellers also manage it, a lot of stuff I get these days is routed through Singapore. Other stuff comes from the Netherlands. So maybe they need a subsidiary or global logistics hub somewhere that is not the US that has cheap global postage like Hong Kong or Taiwan or Singapore or the Netherlands, but I suspect they could do this.

So each share of BABA represents 8 ordinary shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe confusion here on reddit (and stocktwits, twitter, etc), seems to trace back to a CNBC article that announced the results of the vote in favor of the split, without making any mention of the ADS, or the simultaneous ratio change, or the fact that the shares that were splitting weren't even listed yet."", ""This man here...

I have high hopes for the company and think it will be the next amazon but I would love to get some insight.', 'okay so here\'s my personal thoughts on the matter and you can do with that what you will: \n\nCovid exposed a lot of things about the economy that many people know, and others didn\'t want to accept. A big one is working from home. Every single company that exists now has to be, at least in part, a tech company in order to exist at all. Some people say ""the new normal"" with covid tech stocks but they were charting upward before that because they are going to be, and already are, ingrained in every aspect of the global economy possible. Starbucks has its own app, for example. Thats all to say that every single company will be using web services, cyber security, fintech, and online data solutions. Thats all cloud computing. Its the largest growth sector, in my opinion. \n\nI have like 30% of my portfolio in direct cloud offerings, and probably another 20% indirectly (things like MSFT, SE, BABA, etcetera). Ecommerce is the new commerce, and jumping onto those ships now is the healthiest investment possible - again, in my opinion. \n\nI know you said you want to go into renewable energy, banks, etcetera, which is why I think reshuffling to that 60/40 you mentioned is good - but putting the 40 as almost exclusively ETFs. The thing with emerging/speculative markets its that its very hard to narrow down whats going to be a good individual stock within that sector. Thats why I love actively managed ETFs. I can get into sectors I really believe in like automation, genomics, fintech, renewable energy, etcetera &amp; not have to bank on one or two names to get the same growth percentage. I hold about 15 ETFs if you want suggestions I have done like hours and hours of research on them. \n\nThat said, dont move your MSFT position. I know its been said 1000 times on reddit but theres a reason its considered the best long term hold stock', ""here's an older thread. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/h8a6xk/baba\\_split\\_explain\\_please\\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/h8a6xk/baba_split_explain_please_again/)"", 'Put the biggest part in ETFs, maybe take yourself 2K to gamble on amazon calls or Tesla calls or alibaba and so on. And maybe take 10k to buy yourself a small solide car if you don’t already have one', ""Conservative would be broadly diversify over multiple regions of the world. I would go with 40% US, 40% europe and 20% rest of the world. My main reason for this is that I am of the opinion that the value of the dollar is too high in relation to other currencies. Meaning in the next decade or two we will see a more realistic price for the dollar, as in the dollar should be cheaper compared to euro's or yuan than what it is today. This is mainly based on my belief that the USA is artificially keeping the dollar value high, and china and europe still letting the US do this.  But over the next decades, China and maybe Europe too will not allow/need that anymore.\n\nWhat we see now with stock prices being so high is not because they are overvalued, but because the dollar is actually worth less than everyone seems to accept. I think this is especially clear when you look a the valuations of companies that can have revenue in multiple currencies, like aapl, ntflx, amazn, msft etc. They are inherently hedged against the dollar, because they also charge their customers in local currencies. Companies that only have US as a market are priced much more fairly considering the economy within US borders.\n\nBut of course that can all be wrong, but even if it is, a portfolio based on that thinking would probabaly be considered conservative."", 'I just sold all my BABA and TCEHY and moved into NVIDIA and MSFT.

I only buy companies I really believe into (msft, apple, baba, nvda) comission free etfs through my brokerage (such a QQC.F) and I only take short term “bets” with very limited funds (about 5% of the margin account).\n\nHas served me very well. Except, when I got margin called in march and I had to sell some stocks, that are now like 40% to 100% up (SQ, ASML, Xilinx and V) :( On top of the selling, I had to fund $1.5K. So not the end of the world. But you definitely need to have cash on hand to fund in case you get margin called.\n\nI decided to sell part of the portfolio instead of funding most of the deficit, because back in March I had no idea if my job would be cut, so I decided to keep as much cash as I could just in case. Not the best choice in hindsight but hey I gotta cover my back!\n\nAlso, all the interest that is being charged is income tax deductible, so that is nice!', ""I guess you're just way more hardcore than me haha.

In reality due to their enormous cash flows and share buybacks if you purchased the company in March 2016 you were getting your ownership of the business for free within 5 years based on very conservative growth expectations. Needless to say I went overweight in my portfolio. This is what convinced me there are opportunities for individual investors to be successful; the market can be so catastrophically wrong from time to time and prices simply don’t hold up to back of the envelope maths and logic.\n\nI am not wedded to AAPL and will change my opinion if needed. But I look around at my peers, businesses, family, friends kids, and people on the street and I see Apple devices everywhere. \n\nI’ve stopped thinking of Apple like a tech company that has to have the next winning product, and started thinking of it in many ways as a consumer staples company. \n\nAnyway didn’t mean for this to be a deep dive in AAPL. My original reply could easily have said:\n\n1. Nestle / HSY / PEP / BUD\n2. V / MSFT / BABA / ADBE\n3. OKTA /  DDOG\n\nEtc etc\n\nI do think for someone like the OP looking to set up a regular investment they should go with a limited number of businesses at first (three is great), and they should follow those businesses and learn about them deeply and how their numbers work. It is a lot easier to learn to invest when you only have three companies to follow.

Personal opinion here. I bought Apple shares at $170 and sold at $300, great choice, am i mad Apple is worth more now? No i made a profit, and Apple could have tanked with earnings, it’s when you get too greedy is when you start making mistakes and selling at losses and regretting things, set a goal and be happy with it if you achieve it, slow and steady wins the race, big moves make money but also lose money too, and you can be long on stocks, especially blue chips, for example I’m long on baba holding forever, but you must be prepared to lose money too, nothing is a guarantee']"

Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing.

Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.\n\nThe new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.\n\nDetails of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.\n\n\n\n[Thomson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting  ](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/trump-administration-seeks-to-delist-u-s-listed-chinese-companies-for-blocking-audit-inspections/)\n\n-I just saw this right now, just to add to the conversation.

I’m thinking about putting half of it in Alibaba and the other half royal Caribbean.', ""The biggest swings happen when the stock market is closed. Rather than trying to minimise losses with stop losses while it is open, you're better off playing a longer game by looking for oversold stocks and timing your buys and sells across a period of days to weeks.\n\nFor instance, NET and BABA were known to be extremely oversold here in recent days with some days hitting -7% despite the quality of these companies. A good swing trader would have bought those dips and waited for the eventual correction. NET has since shot from 37 to 39+ and BABA from 248 to 252+ today. The trader would be gradually cashing in part of the portfolio right now and moving into another stock.\n\nNaturally, swing trading involves many calculated bets and understanding of fundamentals and technicals, and thus most people don't actually earn much from it compared to people who just buy and hold for years without selling.

Is there a significant competitor like Amazon or Alibaba?', 'Do we know their market share? Is there a significant competitor like Amazon or Alibaba?', ""Their page for BABA has an error with an average analyst price target over $2,000.  A while ago, someone posted all excited that they bought BABA because they saw that on CNN's website and were all excited. It's still there (https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BABA)"", 'Before you buy have a plan, how long your holding and your sell point, say you buy delta at $1- you don’t buy it for the hype or speculation you buy because you believe in the company, delta may go from $1-3 and leave you feeling like you should have picked something else, but delta may go to $20 when travel comes back, you have to choose the stock and know why your buying, airlines are a few years hold until they recover, don’t sell early because it’s not happening now, it’s not a quick money game that’s perhaps day trading, say you sold your delta to buy Apple because the split news and it’s doing sooo good but say after the split the price goes down and you lose money or it’s not as great, then you see delta climbing high and recovering, you can’t buy and sell based on emotion and fear, when i buy i stock i decide it’s potential and how long I’m willing to hold and your profit goal. Example i believe in baba and will hold forever or for a very long time, but my eldorado resorts (now cesears) i got in at a great price and decided before buying when it hits $45-50 I’m selling, thats a GREAT profit for me, I’ve made the mistake before of being greedy and a %60 profit wasn’t enough and i wanted more! Then that stock tanked and I’m an idiot, always set a goal of price or how long you want to hold and don’t get fear of missing out, you bought airlines at a good price? Hold for 2 years, you want tech stocks because they are soaring (don’t buy high sell low) well muster up some cash for the tech stocks, make informed purchases with a plan', 'I did hold only ARKK because all the top ones from ARKW and ARKG were in ARKK.  But if you look past the top 10, in say, ARKW, they are not in ARKK.  So you miss out on BABA, SE and MELI, for example.\n\nWhat I\'d like to know is if MELI gets super hot and is then in ARKW\'s top 10, does it get ""promoted"" up to ARKK?  What is the criteria for a stock joining ARKK?  I dont know really the answer to that question.  \n\nI didn\'t want to miss out on some others that ARKW had, so I dropped ARKK and bought ARKW and ARKG', 'Buying right before earnings can be a dangerous strategy. Of course it can work great, but it can also blow up in your face even when the company reports great results like you expected. Doesn’t mean don’t do it as BABA and Lowe’s are solid long term plays but just warning as it seems like this sub is 90% new investors', 'Is this going to hurt BABA?', ""Both BABA and JD are great businesses, but don't forget Ali's dominant market position in the cloud business"", 'Prob a bad choice but look at BABA calls']"

This whole situation has pulled forward growth for many companies, people are likely to be in many cases even more reliant upon tech in their day-to-day. People have stampeded into names that have benefited from what\'s going on or at least have been far less impacted. E-commerce has had tremendous growth during this and many have discussed that growth lasting beyond this ending. \n\n""Buffet""\n\nI wouldn\'t exactly point to Buffett for anything regarding technology. Nothing against Berkshire by any means, but it\'s not something I\'d ever turn to for technology exposure. There\'s the Apple position now but I don\'t know that Buffett views that entirely as technology; I think in his mind that\'s practically a staple as everyone has a phone now. \n\n""many of the indexes don\'t have a lot of the speculative cloud stocks either, they\'ll have microsoft, apple, and amazon, but won\'t include companies like datadog, twilio, or alibaba for insance..""\n\nLook at the performance for these names YTD. Has this mattered one bit?\n\n""I still feel like something could happen to this overvalued companies""\n\nSo has this sub for much of the last half a decade and if you felt that way this year, you\'ve missed out on one of the best years for growth even after a decade of growth outperforming. There\'s actively managed growth mutual funds up 70% YTD and it\'s not even the end of August. What people have been complaining about as ""too expensive!"" on here was what the market stampeded into after the bottom in March and what this sub has often called ""cheap"" lagged during the downturn and then massively lagged post March low.\n\n""What do you all think, do you think tech stocks should be avoided and what are the reasons to avoid them? ""\n\nThe reason to avoid them at this point is because the kind of performance that you\'ve seen YTD is likely unsustainable and could use a healthy correction beyond just the 3-4 day rotations that have been seen a few times this year. I trimmed a number of aggressive growth names a couple of weeks ago (trimmed, kept the remainder) and I\'m sure at some point you\'re going to see more profit taking in names that have had tremendous years.  If there was a solution to the current crisis tomorrow, there would be a major rotation out of the winners into the losers. However, looking a year out, I think the winners will be higher. The losers? Probably a mixed bag.\n\nAvoiding tech stocks entirely given the rapidly increasing part many names play in every day life I think is a terrible idea but that\'s just me. I wouldn\'t chase them at this point after the year that they\'ve had, but I\'d look to opportunistically add at least some throughout the remainder of the year if there\'s a more substantial pullback (and I\'d be surprised if there isn\'t.)', 'Indexes are best for ultra long term since you don’t have to keep up with them. Motley fool 100 index is my favorite. It tracks the 100 most liquid companies in the S&amp;P500, and QQQ is basically nasdaq (tech based index with 100 stocks). if you want some more risk, but still an actively managed index that you don’t have to worry about checking, ARK has some good ones. ARKK is an index focused on companies utilizing disruptive innovations, and is up 325% over the past 5 years as of right now. If you want individual stocks I only have personal recommendations that I own myself, which would be BAM for real estate, NVDA for AI and semiconductors, BABA, JD, Amazon, and Mercado Libre for e-commerce, and SQ for digital Payments and blockchain advancements.', 'Began buying BABA end of 2015. Now I own 99 stocks for a mean price of 142 € (I\'m located in Europe). While overall my position gained around 58%, which is in no way bad, the same investment in MSFT or Apple or any other FAANG stock would have gained more. \n\nI always felt they are massively undervalued and to be honest, this ""stigma"" was already there in 2015 and is still present today. However, I will hold on to them, as I still believe that they could easily be valued at 400$/stock if they would be treated the same as Amazon. But as others pointed out before, its a Chinese company and therefore does not enjoy the same level of trust as US companies (which I can understand to some degree).\n\nSo if you think the classic FAANG stocks are overhyped and you search for an entry opportunity to buy tech, try BABA :)', 'It happens all the time - take a look at Alibaba in after hours today.\n\nIf you had a bid higher than that in you would have gotten it.

BABA is valued around $800B while TSLA is around $380B.\n\nI am not quite sure if at $800B it is undervalued, maybe just a little bit as AMZN is around 2x this valuation but AMZN is larger, and also AMZN is in the US so there are less risks that is related to BABA being in China.

I am 25yo with medium/high risk tolerance and plan to hold 5+ years. As I wanted to be careful and dont make stupid mistakes I decided to DCA and I wanted to have allocated 1/3 at the beginning, 2/3 after the Q2 earnings and 3/3 probably by March 2021 as I was afraid that the Q2 earnings and possible coronavirus cases surge could hit the market hard.\n\nTo the matter I want to discuss, I am currently invested in 25 stocks + btc and eth (btc:eth 3:1) and I have managed to allocate only 1/2 resources even though I thought I will have 2/3 of my cash I am willing to invest already in the market. The problem is, that as I currently hold 25 stocks I really dont want to hold any more as it would be almost impossible to keep track of them. However I find it really hard to add to the winners now as some of them are more than 50% higher from the initial trade price.\n\nMy portfolio from higher allocations to lower allocations:\n\nAAPL, FB, MSFT, UNH, MA, LMT, NVDA, TTD, INTC, CIEN, KL, REGI\n\nTDOC, ZTS, IAC, DIS, CRWD, ISRG\n\nBABA, MKL, IDXX, V, UNP, WM, NOW\n\nAny suggestions what would you do? I can see that I will add some funds to companies that have not surged by 30% in the last month (looking at you NVDA, AAPL and REGI) and have lagged for some time. The only problem with this is that I wanted to allocate more money to some blue chips like AAPL, FB or MA but at those prices I cant see myself doing it (maybe MA).\n\nIf you have any notes/suggestions to my portfolio, I am more than happy to hear your opinion (like that I am heavy allocated in US market, but I wasnt able to solve it yet).\n\nThank you for any feedback.', '##Top trending tickers, sentiments, and options on /r/stocks for the day of August 26, 2020.\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Tickers:\n\n**Ticker**|**Company**|**Mentions**|**Bulls / Bears**|**Price**|**Change**|**P/E**\n:-:|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nMSFT|Microsoft Corporation|206|86.67% / 13.33%|$220.79|2.00%|37.56\nAAPL|Apple Inc.|142|92.86% / 7.14%|$504.27|1.00%|37.95\nAMD|Advanced Micro Device|110|85.71% / 14.29%|$86.11|-0.28%|171.67\nTSLA|Tesla, Inc.|107|72.73% / 27.27%|$2155.85|6.55%|1041.35\nAMZN|Amazon.com, Inc.|98|100.00% / 0.00%|$3438.15|2.74%|128.63\nQQQ|Exchange Traded Fund|94|86.67% / 13.33%|$291.61|2.01%|-\nDIS|The Walt Disney Compa|79|100.00% / 0.00%|$132.16|1.83%|-\nV|Visa Inc.|77|100.00% / 0.00%|$210.38|1.10%|39.57\nNET|Cloudflare, Inc.|71|80.00% / 20.00%|$39.99|2.47%|-\nNIO|NIO Limited|66|94.44% / 5.56%|$20.39|14.28%|-\nFB|Facebook, Inc.|65|100.00% / 0.00%|$303.07|7.92%|35.83\nSQ|Square, Inc.|60|100.00% / 0.00%|$153.87|-0.73%|343.68\nNVDA|NVIDIA Corporation|58|100.00% / 0.00%|$510.60|0.12%|95.22\nBABA|Alibaba Group Holding|55|100.00% / 0.00%|$291.63|1.97%|30.15\nVOO|Exchange Traded Fund|55|100.00% / 0.00%|$319.35|1.00%|-\nRTX|Raytheon Technologies|52|80.00% / 20.00%|$60.74|-0.35%|149.39\nARKK|Exchange Traded Fund|50|100.00% / 0.00%|$91.47|2.20%|-\nKO|The Coca-Cola Company|50|100.00% / 0.00%|$48.13|0.47%|22.54\nBA|The Boeing Company|50|100.00% / 0.00%|$171.92|-1.61%|-\nJPM|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.|47|66.67% / 33.33%|$99.28|-1.22%|13.54\nSE|Sea Limited|43|- / -|$158.60|2.90%|-\nMA|Mastercard Incorporat|42|100.00% / 0.00%|$351.44|1.09%|48.29\nDAL|Delta Air Lines, Inc.|39|100.00% / 0.00%|$29.81|-0.98%|-\nT|AT&amp;T Inc.|36|100.00% / 0.00%|$29.99|0.28%|18.25\nBRK-B|Berkshire Hathaway In|35|100.00% / 0.00%|$214.65|0.61%|0.02\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Options:\n\n**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Expiration**\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nSNAP|$23|Call|7/10\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Trending Sentiment:\n\n**Sentiment**|**Comments**|**%**\n:--|:--|:--\nBullish|214|69.71%\nNeutral|1133|-\nBearish|93|30.29%\n\n\n────────────────\n\n###Other Data:\n\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** Bullish\n\n**Comments Searched:** 1440\n\n**Newly Trending Tickers:** None\n\n────────────────\n\nYou can view all top trending tickers on /r/RedditTickers.\n\nNotice an error or have questions?
