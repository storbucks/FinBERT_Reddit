I would second his recommendation of not touching it.\n\nTwo things:\n\nFirst, if you know nothing about the restaurant industry, you have to ask why the prior investor is running away. Yes, it's obvious that someone would be affraid of uncertainty, but this guy knows more than you or I about the segment. If he or she is trying to sell, you have to ask yourself what do they know that I don't. And saying that they are risk averse isn't really a reason, because they already invested in the business. It's like asking the question, how do you beat LeBron James? (Get him to play a game other than basketball.) \n\n\nSecond, for those with an expertise in epidemiology or infectious disease, this COVID thing is a lot more than they let on. We are still early days on understanding this situation or the long term impacts of the disease (For example Rudy Gobert has his taste back after months of recovery from the virus...but none of his smell.) Lots of long term consequences that are not understood; especially what will happen this winter. I project (as do many other experienced entrepreneurs) that we are in for a world of hurt this year. Mark Cuban was aggressive in stocks right after the dip but has reduced his positions after a month or so after he bought more in the pandemic. Smart guys like Buffet are holding cash. Analysts are expecting this quarter earnings to be historically bad (like once in a lifetime bad) and the economists that you can rely on expect a sharp uptick in Q3 and / or Q4 with very small increases each quarter after that. When you add in the risk of COVID getting worse in winter, it didn't bode well for small business. So two things with that. First, you shouldn't be signing up for risky businesses you don't know enough about when the economy can freeze again... especially when you're in a state that is amenable to shutting down at a moment's notice. Second, cash will be king...more so than it is now. There will be lots of deals coming up. So don't feel the need to jump quickly at the first one. Given your age, this is probably your first financial crisis as an adult. You will have an opportunity, probably a great one again soon. (By the way, real estate is starting to soften after months of it ripping because of low supply. It will only get weaker as prices are starting to reflect the new realities)\n\nWatch people like Buffet and Sam Zell.

This is straight up Orwellian.\n\nFor me, twitter views different value judgments from their own as “misinformation.” And, because they hold this view, they are ultimately going to lose legal protection for the things posted on their platform.

If Lemonade can settle 90%+ of claims without an adjuster that\'s revolutionary. They\'d shave 10 points off their permissible loss ratio on that alone.

And in turn to maximize the revenue from our macro tower sites and our in-building systems capabilities. Edge compute solutions at tower sites are one example. As data demand increases on both wired and wireless networks, our macro tower sites have the potential to act as convergence points for wireless access networks, cloud services, the Internet of Things and enterprise networks, given the tower\'s positioning on the edge of today\'s mobile networks. As 5G supported applications it require minimal latency develop, there could be a further opportunity for edge compute to play an even more important role, especially in the establishment of autonomous air and ground vehicle management and control systems, autonomous cars and drones.\n\nTo better understand the potential of this and other industry developments. We\'re already moving forward with trial edge data centers at several of our US tower sites and also have acquired a mid-size interconnect facility in Atlanta earlier this year. We\'re using this limited scope architecture to learn as much as possible about potential future business models and to work together with some prospective future tenants as they evolve their approaches to this type of distributed data storage and compute technology.\n\nDrone applications are another promising area, where we continue to focus efforts within our innovation program as well. We\'re already using drones internally which promote safety and enhances our site monitoring and maintenance functions, similar to what we anticipate from our mobile operator tenants, we\'re first using this technology to reduce our unit cost of operations as well as increase the quality and the cycle time of our site inspections and structural analysis.\n\nIn the longer term, we continue to believe that our tower sites could play a significant role in a 5G enabled drone air traffic control system and we\'re working toward that goal. Already UPS, Google and some others have received regulatory clearance to begin drone deliveries for limited purposes and specific geographic areas, which we see as an indication to us that progress is being made.\n\nThen there is augmented and virtual reality autonomous long haul trucking, smart factories and buildings and a myriad of other next generation applications that are also in the 5G pipeline. Many of these will be deployed by existing mobile operators, industry verticals or even by the government. Some may ultimately fail to gain traction or scale, while there may be others that we aren\'t even thinking about today that will be introduced by creative entrepreneurs, just like the founders of Uber and Lyft did when a robust 4G platform became available to them.""

No one really knows how this will work in the end. But, if prices for corporate bonds are low because of the economic prospects, then issuing new bonds right now for extra cash would be disadvantageous to the firms seeking a money injection. So, by having the Fed come in and start randomly buying segments of investment grade corporate bonds, it reduces the supply, drives up prices overall and allows the major corporations to issue entirely new rounds of debt which now sell at a premium (because of their short supply thanks to the Fed). So, that means more cash for the corporations, which wouldn’t otherwise be available to them. \n\nFurthermore, by driving up the prices of corporate bonds, it depresses their yields ... And remember with fixed income: *higher prices = lower yields, and higher yields = lower prices* ...

The entire economy did not grind to a complete halt. I should have been more precise.  Large segments of the economy ground to *nearly* a complete halt and many more have been significantly affected.  But I think you are unrealistically minimizing the breadth and depth of the problem.  First,  many states did literally ""shut down"" for up to two months.  And even those that didn\'t imposed significant restrictions on business and freedom of movement.  Restaurants,  bars, airlines, hotels, rental cars, short term rental properties, gyms, salons, theaters, arenas, stadiums, concert and performance venues, museums, indoor kids activities,  and things like bookstores, department stores, and other reatilers have been seriously affected and will continue to be for some time. There may have been cause for optimism 6 weeks ago. Sure enough,  the stock market exploded at the first tenuous signs of recovery.  But those hopes were promptly dashed as states reopened and the virus spread even further out of control than it had in March. Now states are shutting things back down again and will continue to do so.  And it\'s looking less and less likely that schools will be able to reopen next month.  I don\'t know what ""en masse"" means,  but three of the five largest states in the country are overwhelmed right now. California recently announced that most schools will not reopen. Florida wants to open schools but it\'s not going to be possible in many counties. Schools being closed will affect every industry. And of course the market has responded by.... ignoring the grim realistic outlook and continuing to blow up on the theory that it\'s only younger people, or there are fewer deaths and hospitalizations, or states won\'t need to shut back down again --- every which hope has been immediately proven wrong,  and which the market continues to ignore. \n\n Other countries were able to basically eradicate the virus at the outset with swift testing and tracing.  But the virus spread virtually undetected in the U.S. for weeks and weeks due to large numbers of forgein visitors at multiple ports of entry and botched initial testing by the CDC (which relied on contaminated, ineffective tests for weeks) and by FDA (which initially prevented states from using their own tests). By the time we got our ducks in a row, the virus had spread far too widely to eradicate.  Add to that the fact that we have an inherently weak federal government, by design,  and a huge population beholden to 50 different state governments that are primarily responsible for regulating the health and welfare, and further add that right now, we just so happen to have an incompetent and inept federal administration that has neither the desire nor ability to effectuate even the limited responsibilities that would normally fall to the federal government in our system.\n\nYes, people are adapting.

But huge numbers of people previously contributed to society (and our GDP) by providing goods or services that are suddenly unwanted,  unneccessary, or impossible to safely provide (bar service, sit down restaurant service, professional sports and other entertainment,  travel,  and tourism). Many of those people are now no longer contributing anything to society or the GDP at the moment. Some even by choice  because the federal government has been subsidizing people to stay home by paying them more than what they had been making or would make if they returned to work! That in turn is being subsidized by additional federal debt, which is exploding at a time when economic output is being greatly curtailed.

They face two primary issues. First, Nike’s global Point-of-Sale (POS) system is fragmented among many intermediaries: different payment gateways, service providers, acquirers, and processors. This structure inherently increases costs as fees are paid to each intermediary in the process. Additionally, it is challenging to create a single view of their customer since they must consolidate payment data from brick-and-mortar, online, and mobile providers. Second, consumer payment preferences around the world differ, meaning Nike must work with a new set of intermediaries for every different geography and form of payment the customer would like to use (e.g., Visa, Alipay, Giropay). This complex, global distribution channel means more vendor contracts, more system and process integrations, and ultimately, higher costs.\n\nIn 2015, Nike chose Adyen as their payments processor to solve these problems. **Adyen is a payment gateway, service provider, acquirer, and processor for online and brick-and-mortar commerce.

But your bias against the valuation and unwillingness to treat it like what it is are coloring your analysis. \n\nCapex - Toyota and Ford are capexing out the ass explicitly to design cars and factories that can become what Tesla already is, not to maintain what they have. \n\nStartup status - when Tesla sold the roadster and the S, it was not the same kind of company it is now. Then it was not ""serious"", it was a billionaire designing a cool toy. Now it has used the success of that endeavor to reboot and is starting again, almost from ground 0 with new models of cars. That\'s why it\'s ""a startup"". Because it has essentially started over. And to your point about employees and market cap, you can\'t say it\'s not worth 300B then say it\'s a 300B company in your next argument.  We agree it hasn\'t yet earned it\'s value, and that\'s why I believe it\'s closer to a startup operating structure. They have a lot of volume to achieve to prove they are viable for the long term. \n\nMetrics - if you want to use strictly GAAP, the company is profitable. If you want to subtract regulatory credits from GAAP net income and not make other judgmental adjustments to ascertain true product profitability, that\'s poor analysis. My argument is if you want to say the core business isn\'t profitable, start from operating cash flow and add activity back into the mix, don\'t start from GAAP and go backwards. Operating cash is the corest of the core. GAAP is full of averaging and BS (I am a CPA, I have familiarity with it). \n\nRevenue - perhaps this is the most important part of disagreement on Tesla analysis. You are 100% correct - the things that make Tesla ""not a car company"" are currently tiny. The buyers of the stock aren\'t predicting today\'s or next quarter\'s revenue. They are predicting 2030 and 2040 self driving battery efficient unicorn cars that don\'t exist yet.\n\nYou don\'t have to believe it or buy it, but to say nothing in this report shows you anything positive is a mistake.']"

If someone asks a decent enough question and not a one liner asking to be spoon fed the info then that’s contributing to the discussion and thus the point of this, right? I will admit even being a newbie I can see a ton of people asking basic questions I researched, but I think there is a segment of us that genuinely want to tap into some veteran potential here. Yeah we are asking an open forum but it seems more impartial than googling which will land us with hundreds of sites trying to get us to pay for useless info we won’t understand. I use the same search function before I ask a question and I take time to read the responses and cross reference anything I don’t understand, but sometimes if I’m really undecided after that I like to ask. I will say that people here have been very friendly and offered quick responses( but some others (very small minority) seem to expend energy just to mock new people and basically tell them “what do you think?” And “go do some research”.

It falls into the same timing category it's very hard. If you were to pursue that you need to define some time frames. Is the consensus that it will outperform over the next year or next quarter or next week. And then what would your target holding period/period range be? The other issue is how are you measuring consensus. You could use anecdotal evidence of listening to CNBC or reading reddit or something else but you need to be able to measure what consensus is. The other thing I think most don't consider, particularly new people getting into trading, is that as your target investment horizon gets shorter, investing becomes more of a mathematical and speed-based game. In time frames of a month and less computers are now used to inform trades more than human judgment on a trade by trade basis. If you enter a game that is won by speed and a very large potential investment universe using humans to determine and execute trades you're likely to lose money.\n\nI don't use technical analysis. I know some people swear by it and most professionals I have known make fun of it but I wouldn't knock it because every strategy can have holes poked in them and everyone has different philosophies. If you can be successful using it then it doesn't matter to me what it is. If you were starting from scratch I would suggest certain strategies over others but I think people need to do what is comfortable for them and where they think they can be successful. I don't think strategy diversification is good because you are probably diluting a strategy you are good at with strategies you are not good at. This is something we are considering at my firm blending long-term fundamental analysis with quantitative factor based analysis but you need to determine how do you make sure they work together effectively instead of competing with one another. We also wouldn't have both strategies executed by the same person. Both disciplines are full time jobs and different skill sets."", 'It’s climbing because of the halvening. The supply got cut in half.  That hurt the miners and we had to wait for them to capitulate because they have fixed costs like leases and energy agreements that they had to run out even mining at a loss.  IF they have capitulated, leaving only the most bullish miners, we will start our run. Not sure if they have because we never saw a heavy dip, possibly due to so much retail interest keeping the price up despite them.

AVCT resells software and hardware products from vendors such as Cisco and Meraki to customers in a variety of market segments including oil/gas, healthcare, and finance. AVCT also offers value added services including architecture consulting, support/maintenance, and 24/7 monitoring with NOCs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory\n\nAVCT is a former SPAC that emerged from Pensare Acquisition Corporation, shich went public in July 2017 as a blank-check company designed to take a private company public. Pensare was formed with then intent of merging with a telecommunications company and had backing from Navigation Capital Partners (a private equity firm based out of Atlanta) and MasTec (a $6.5B+ revenue infrastructure services company).\n\nPensare initially planned to merge with TPX Communications but the deal fell apart in  May, 2019. In July, 2019 Pensare announced a new deal to merge with Computex Technology Solutions, a 30+ year old technology services company. The deal closed in April, 2020 and Pensare changed its name to AVCT.***\\[***\n\nCurrent Market Cap\n\nAVCT is currently trading at a market cap of around $85m. The stock price is $4.35.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullish Indicators\n\n\\* The CEO used to be a senior executive at MasTec. This could mean that MasTec will be helping AVCT closely to secure new revenue streams and close deals.\n\n\\* The CEO is a former entrepreneur who started a company called ""nsoro"" and sold it to MasTec.\n\n\\* Leadership has experience at major companies including AT&amp;T, Panasonic, and Vonage.\n\n\\* In past public filings AVCT has indicated a deal with AT&amp;T that could bring up to $400m a year in revenue.\n\n\\* One of AVCT\'s focuses is UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service). This is a category of software that helps employees to work remotely. Remote work is a strong trend right now.\n\n\\* AVCT executives have announced via a press release that they intend to continue acquiring more companies to grow revenue.\n\nSource: [https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis)\n\nRisks\n\n\\* Publicly available filings from Computex indicate less than $90m yearly revenue. This was reduced from over $100m in revenue due to an FASB accounting change that forced Computex to reduce the revenue it recognizes upfront.\n\n\\* There is significant risk of dilution to at least 37m shares. The merger was closed with additional a PIPE that requires assigning debentures to investors. These debentures can convert into shares and penny warrants that would raise shares outstanding to around 37m. There is further possibility of dilution from approximately 14m AVCTW warrants which have a strike price of $11.50.\n\n\\* The deal with AT&amp;T may or may not generate $400m of revenue.\n\n\\* AVCT\'s first earnings report is coming out in August, so there is not yet firm knowledge on what financials for the latest quarter look like.\n\nVery Bullish Price Target\n\n\\* In the very bullish case, we expect AVCT to trade at 2x TTM revenues\n\n\\* If the AT&amp;T deal generates revenues in addition to existing revenue from Computex, total annual revenues could be $600m ($400m from AT&amp;T deal and $200m from existing Computex revenues).\n\n\\* At 2x EV/TTM (assuming insignificant debt) and full dilution (including public warrants) this would place stock price above $20 and warrant price between $8 and $10.\n\nBullish Price Target\n\n\\* In the bullish case, we expect AVCT to trade at 2x TTM revenues\n\n\\* If the AT&amp;T deal generates no revenues in addition to existing revenue from Computex, total annual revenues could be $200m.\n\n\\* At 2x EV/TTM (assuming insignificant debt) and full dilution (including public warrants) this would place stock price at $8 and warrant price at $1.50.', 'MSFT is already in social media / ad space with LinkedIn but it is a much different demographic more suited to its enterprise / B2B segments.

Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues.\n\nIntel bulls should pay close attention to this part. Bulls talk all the time about Intel's superior margins, but those margins are not some Intel magic. They're just a function of\n\n(a) A large market for 14nm chips where they have lots of capacity that's probably pretty depreciated and the per unit cost is super low. \n\n(b) Intel maintains its strength in datacenter where the margins are super juicy and have been the biggest driver of Intel's earnings growth for the last few years.\n\nIf the highest margin products get chased off 14nm because of heat, yield, performance, etc. issues vs AMD and Intel's next process isn't ready to take up the banner, its margins will fall quickly. Operational leverage in industries with high capital expenditures works both ways.\n\nBulls will also point to Intel's large growth in datacenter/enterprise, but that's mainly because of the emergency expansion of computing capacity of its existing client setups because of covid-19 and Intel's security patches. At some level of performance disparity, organizations will commit to Epyc for newer setups as Microsoft and Google have already done for their cloud solutions.\n\n14nm is now under strong assault in every product segment from AMD. Even Intel's OEM cabal is starting to lose faith because of inventory and performance issues. 10nm yield has questionable economic viability in terms of yield and performance; it's already a burning platform. 7nm is the last shot for Intel's former glory, and I just see bad news.\n\nIntel has other initiatives, but I doubt that they'll grow fast enough to offset the x86 pain that is coming in the next 2 years."", ""I didn't touch on this in the article, but my view is that their edge computing is largely subsidised by x86.

However, our results show that for macro-level analy- sis it is not safe to assume that economic perceptions stand outside the political and social arena. Economic perceptions are indeed the byproduct of judgments made by individuals with different partisan orientations, and these partisan perceptions do not cancel in the aggregate.\n\n&gt;As this study shows, the effect of partisanship in economic perceptions is important. It is almost universally accepted that the state of the economy is a primary determinant of presidential approval (Brody 1991; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Hibbs 1987; McAvoy 2006). However, the results from this analysis offer an important revision to our understanding of the way in which the public holds the president accountable for economic conditions. We show that, after controlling for the partisan component of consumer senti- ment, objective economic conditions produce no significant short-term effects on approval of the president’s handling of the economy. The influence of the economy on presidential evaluations is incremental.\n\n&gt;Although the focus of this study is on macropolitics viewed over time, the analyses have some implications for micro-level studies as well. By looking over time, we find that the effects of partisanship are stronger in some peri- ods (like under the George W. Bush Administration) and almost non-exist- ent in others (as was the case during the economic expansion of the Clinton Administration). Thus, even though partisan perceptions are the norm, condi- tions do exist in which the public overcomes its partisan biases, and economic perceptions and reality are in sync (Enns and McAvoy forthcoming; McAvoy and Enns 2010).', 'CARR is not the lesser known stock; it has 7x the average volume of TT although Trane is the HVAC market leader I believe.

I don't agree with your points personally, but I think they are well thought out and rationalised.\n\nMaybe not necessarily counter points, but a couple of things that come to mind are:\n\n* **Lack of new product segments/innovation:** I see this as a super common complaint about Apple, but truth be told I think because people don't see a hugely game changing product like the iPhone or iPad they assume this is true. I believe it's not. Take the Apple Watch for example, which is now about 5 years old. It's now one of the best selling wearable devices in a segment that's growing. Sure it's a digital watch (to over simplify it) so it's not ground breaking, but the useability has jumped in leaps and bounds since Gen 1 which is driving it's success. Airpods are another example. I think where %'s are concerned, yes iPhone dominates it's revenue streams, but %'s don't necessarily tell the story. 5 or 6 years ago, if you bought an iPhone, that'd be it. Now you are likely to buy Airpods and an Apple Watch to go along with it. So regardless of whether iPhone sales go up or down, Apple has already bolstered it's revenue streams with these add-on accessories. Yes you're right Apple needs iPhone as a gateway product (and Watch only works with iPhone), but there are so many Airpod android users (and it's one of the best selling android bluetooth headphones, or at least were previously).\n* **Management and People:** One thing that gets discounted too often is the talent within of some of these companies. People often look at the figurehead, whether that's Steve Jobs, Tim Cook or Johnny Ive and tie the companies fortune against them. What Apple have shown is that they are long past the era where 1 person makes or breaks the company. There is clearly a fantastic team of people working at the company that's driving this performance, even if they aren't the ones in the head lines\n* **Share market is crazy:** This kind of ties with the point above. Ultimately it looks as though the share market has decided that it's just going to look as far into the future as possible and price based on that. That would explain some of the crazy P/Es we're seeing in big, established companies. I think people (and have been for a while) are pricing in unknowns due to proven track records. This is most likely the case with Apple, and has been for years now. I know past performance is not indicative of future performance, but one thing Apple management has shown is that they certainly know how to meet or exceed already lofty expectations consistently.\n\nI know you didn't say AAPL bad, so I'm not trying to discredit anything you've written.\n\nDisclosure: I'm a happy holder, but happy to pick up more if it comes crashing again."", 'Agreed but the industry is too fragmented.

Thanks for taking so much time to formulate a thoughtful response. \n\nI don't know if I believe that podcasters will necessarily make less money here. Spotify's podcast model seems to fork: \n\n1) Giving podcasters the ability to put their podcasts on spotify and gain exposure to a larger audience without needing to be exclusive. Podcasters can STILL sell advertising on their podcasts and still have their content on all platforms for free.\n\n2) Signing exclusive deals with podcasters - I have to believe that if podcasters are willing to sign these deals, they're making more money by signing over to Spotify than they would on their own.\n\nSpotify has an inherent network effect that current radio and podcasting is limited by. And that is the fact that Spotify is global and international. \n\nI'm pulling netflix as an example here again bc I think it's relevant. When Netflix creates content, they do so on a completely global scale. Content that performs in India, also has the ability to perform well in the US and vice-versa. \n\nAlso I disagree that podcasting is clean in its current form. It's so fragmented across so many different apps. People have to intentionally try to find podcasts that are relevant to them. Even though the content is free, the fact that someone might find a podcast relevant to them through Spotify PLUS being able to utilize Spotify as a place to listen to music as well, maximizes the value to Spotify subscribers. Ultimately it's a win for subscribers. Whether it's a win for content creators is another discussion. \n\nI've already discovered so many new podcasts because of Spotify's discoverability feature. I believe you when you say that the algorithm hasn't been working well for you, but I really doubt it's the case for most Spotify subscribers. \n\nI see music as Spotify's market penetration and customer acquisition strategy. It might not make money for Spotify due to licensing, but it's clear that for consumers the convenience of having all your favorite artists in one place is enticing enough to justify a subscription. But when you have the experience of not only having your favorite artists in one place, but also your favorite comedians, and talk show hosts? That builds loyalty. Podcasting is their long-term monetization and retention strategy. \n\nAlso I would disagree that this doesn't make things cheaper and easier. For some consumers (myself included) time is money. The convenience of having all of your preferred listening on a single app is certainly convenient for me, even I have to pay a monthly fee for it. I'm sure I could piecemeal all of the things I listen to into different free apps, but that would take a lot of effort. For the time that it would take to do this, I'd rather just subscribe to a single app. \n\nTake movies for instance - I used to pirate movies and music because I didn't want to rent or buy them in person. I wanted the stuff digitally. I now rent movies through iTunes on my Apple TV because it's cheap enough and convenient. Sure, I could save $3 by finding a way to pirate it, but now it's convenient enough for me to pay and watch at the same time.\n\nBut hey I welcome your differing point of view. As a new shareholder I selfishly hope you're wrong :P\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso - I want to address your point about advertising being a loss for consumers and podcasters. I don't know if it's necessarily a loss for both sides. Podcast listeners are already accustomed to hearing advertising (as that's how podcasters make money anyway). Instead, now podcasts can play advertising that is directly relevant to their audience because of the data that Spotify has on listeners. Is there a possibility that podcasters can actually win in this scenario by getting advertising they normally wouldn't through their content?

Be a flexible investor; people on here are individual investors for the most part. You don\'t run a large cap value fund and therefore are only limited to value. If value isn\'t working, look around and be flexible. ""Value will work again someday!"" = statement I\'ve heard every year for the last several.

On each loan sold, RKT records a gain on sale and this figure has dropped from 3.97% in 2017 to 3.19% in 2019. There is a reason behind this and that is that the market share growth mostly comes from an increase in partner revenue. If we look at the direct origination volume, the market share was 4.3% in 2019, up from 4% in 2017.\n\nRKT has been stepping its recruitment of partners in 2019, as the data below shows. This also explains the lower gain on sale margins, as PN delivered an average gain on sale of only 0.77% of origination volume in 2019, lower than the gain on sale of 4.45% in the company\'s DTC segment.\n\nIn fact, the company probably lowered its margin in 2018 and 2019 in order to attract more partner networks. If this was the strategy, it was clearly a success, but lowering margins to gain business is not a very sustainable business model.\n\nAt $350m, PN\'s impact on profitability is also modest. By comparison: the contribution margin of DTC is $2.4bn. The contributions of both segments have to cover unallocated expenses of $1.4bn. Because of the unallocated expenses, I find it highly questionable whether these partners have really been profitable to the business in 2019. In theory, if RKT used partners to increase its market share to 50% of mortgage originations (using 2019 figures), that would net the PN segment a contribution margin of $6bn. However, I highly doubt whether much of that will trickle through to the bottom line.”', ""&gt;P/E is 150:1, and no dividends\n\n&gt;Intel's is 9:1 and pays 2-3% in dividends \n\nI really think Intel is the better long-term play, they're not a one-trick pony or overvalued.

Whether its the psn,micorsoft, steam, google play store or brick and mortar stores like gamestop. The 20 percent discount epic gave was also available on the console versions but only on the mobile versions could you cut out the store front's share. From what i can gather the iOS store asks for $100.00 annually. If you plan on selling there that fee should be factored into the business model. But in 2018 fortnite made 2.4 billion dollars. Thats money made on a free to play game. So this is really a matter of greed. If apple said you get the discount on the console fortnite without paying us a cut then apple would be wrong. But there were two options in the game app. Pay for the currency normally or pay with a 20 percent reduction for the consumer. Which makes it more enticing and epic gets 10 percent more then if they had paid normally. On top of that this deal was added in via a non approved update. Epic is definitely in the wrong."", 'Price to performance will not be comparable. You can quote me on this later.

Based off synthetic benchmarks graphics also looks pretty good. The thing is for now it may favorably compete with Renoir U series but H series tiger Lake chips are not expected anytime soon and by the time they arrive AMD will have Zen 3 APU ready.

Why spend money to build something on Google technology, when they can kill it in 2 or 3 years? They also seem to break their things a lot, what frustrates engineers, because instead of adding new things, they are \'fighting\' with Google.\nAlso supposedly customer support is better for companies, but for normal people, there simply is none: there is no email where you get a human, just some AI-replies that tell you to fuck-off.

Maybe not by current market cap...but we know market cap can be inflated.\n\nThe rapid expansion of Amazon in 2010 will be something that is studied in economic classes for the next century. This is a company that went from an online bookstore to e-commerce juggernaut in 10 years and then went from an e-commerce juggernaut to a IT juggernaught in the last five. Its honestly hard to point at any one thing that Amazon does anymore and say ""This is what Amazon does."" Obviously they\'re still huge in e-commerce, but now they\'re also getting huge in cloud computing (AWS), AI (Alexa), big data (also Alexa), and streaming (Prime). Additionally Amazons supply chain managmemt is insane, the actual logistics behind taking control of 2 day Prime shipping with their huge distribution centers is something that only a select few retailers like Walmart can rival. 5 years ago you almost never saw an Amazon delivery truck, now theyre as common as UPS and FedEx.\n\nAmazon is not without its failures, they never hit it big in the hardware market...the Kindle was ultimately a flop. If you brought up stuff like Amazon Spark or Amazon Restarunts in casual most people would have no clue what you are even talking about.\n\nSo where does Amazon go from here?\n\n1 - International Expansion - Amazon has struggled to expand into Europe finding that their economic policy is much less lenient than US. Their business practices are under much more scrutiny, and they are subject to much higher regulation than in the US. Additionally they have no real foot into areas like China or South America and have let competitors like Alibaba and MercadoLibre gain a competitve advantage. International expansion will be a key metric to track for Amazon in the 2030\'s if they are to continue their growth.\n\n2 - Physical Storefronts - Whole Foods is the first step, the second step will come into play in the next 12-24 months with acquisition of a large retailer like JCP or Maceys. This is the largest gamble they are currently taking as storefront retail is sometimes seen as a dying buisness model. The question is, what does a Amazon store look like and what is its use in the overall .\n\n3 - Anti-trust/self inforced breakup - Always a risk but my hot take is that Bezos would split Amazon into 4-6 different smaller Amazons prior to exposing the entire entire company to antitrust litigation.

The long and short of it is the company knew they would be running out of money and pulled an extra $436M from a revolving credit line then chose not to make an interest payment on one of their senior bonds.  By doing that and going into default all their debt became due because of cross default agreements, but they filed for bankruptcy protection prior to that in order to sort out claims against the company and its assets.\n\nAs for seeing this coming the trajectory on earnings, cashflow and EBITDA have been horrible in the offshore drilling sector for a while now.  DO also had a debt downgrade from to CCC+ back in the Q3 2019 filing you linked which indicates high uncertainty over prinicpal repayment.  COVID and OPEC+ failing to reach an agreement in 2020 was the icing on the cake really.\n\nSince DO has filed two other large offshore drillers have filed for Chapter 11, NE several weeks ago and VAL just this last week.  In both cases you could see it coming because the companies were just going to breach their debt covenants based on their rate of cash burn.  Personally I shorted VAL down from its fairly recent spike above $2.00 through the filing this week closing out my position on Friday.\n\nThese companies have kind of been zombies for a while with even OCF being negative and them just continually taking on additional debt to just to keep things running in hopes of a substantial turn around materializing.  That didn't happen and with oil prices crashing earlier this year there were some pretty substantial book value write downs too.  Book value would be very misleading because their rigs have almost no value or buyers if they need to actually liquidate them.  Most of what book value is what the company expects it can earn off those assets over their lifetime along with some discounting.  So they effectively don't have assets they can liquidate to pay down debt or get cash to continue operating if they really need to.\n\nFor the same reason it makes sense them for them to file for bankruptcy like this.  Equity gets wiped out but banks and bond holders have almost no incentive to go through Chapter 7 and attempt to liquidate the company either.  It's better for everyone to keep the contracted assets operating and generating some money than it is to try to find a buyer right now.\n\nWhat's happened industry wide in the offshore drill sector and specifically the UDW segment is that we just have not seen rig retirements.  Seadrill filed back in 2017 and had a terrible prepackaged bankruptcy that didn't clear off much debt or retire many rigs, some of the ones they did sell off were picked up by Borr Drilling anyways iirc and didn't really leave the global supply pool.  Seadrill will probably file Chapter 11 again within the next year and have stated they're considering it already.  Transocean might be forced to next year as well either because the tendering markets will decay further or they just won't be able to compete with all  these competitors that are leaving bankruptcy with much less debt and the ability to underbid them on new contracts.\n\nMost of this stuff is disclosed in the risk factors section of their 10-K, especially the stuff about how they get to the carrying value of their rigs.  Here's an excerpt: \n\n&gt;  We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment, reflecting management’s assumptions and estimates regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted dayrate by rig, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by their nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets, which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.\n\nThey also repeatedly note the oversupplied nature of the market and state that impairments to the value of their rigs could trigger covenants on their revolving credit facility too.\n\nCharts alone never tell the whole story and you really need to dig into these companies especially if they don't have cash flows to support their current valuation and you're relying on their balance sheet as a backstop."", ""ge has been downhill since october of 2000. sure there might be some ups but don't expect anything over 31.\n\nGE is no longer the GE of old. they are getting 34% of their profits from making plane parts right now.\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/""]"

Sometimes you can’t buy 1 share because it costs too much. Take $AMZN for example or $TSLA. So you could see if your broker offers fractional shares as a service. If not you have several options.

Another opportunity would be to invest in options via simple calls. Options allow you too leverage a smaller amount of cash to control the right not obligation to buy shares at a future date. For example, if you think $AMZN will continue to increase in price you can buy a call option 3-4 months from now with a higher strike price or price you think it could be at. 1 contract controls 100 shares.

2020-08-27,"['Yeah I thought about covering the energy segment, but I decided my post was long enough already.  \n\nI\'m gonna be a bit more harsh here:  Tesla\'s TTM solar installations are less than their Q4 2016 installations, ~180 MW to 210 MW.  [Just look at this pitiful graph](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/custom/tesla-solar-deployed-q22020.png).  Their storage has been stagnant.  Their gross margins, as of H1 this year, were 6%.  Just abysmal.  There\'s no value in their energy business.  Bull case would be they scrap it, and focus on cars where they can actually manage ~20% gross margins.  The capex required just isn\'t an efficient allocation for a company like Tesla at their current stage.  \n\nYou couldn\'t pay me own shares in Tesla Energy if they spun it off.  \n\nI also didn\'t address ""Tesla the tech company.""  Tesla is no more a tech company than any other major auto company.  Everyone is trying to use technology and software to develop a qualitative or cost advantage.  \n\nI should also mention, a common -yet rudimentary- bull theory for Tesla is ""they\'re so innovative, they\'re changing the way the world works!""  Innovation =/= Profitability.  You could innovate to create a longer lasting light bulb -or even a longer lasting battery, *hint hint*- but that only ruins your long term profitability.  In fact, a cartel reduced light bulb life to ensure profitability.  An apt comparison would be Nikola Tesla himself, a genius who commercialized AC current, revolutionizing the way power was delivered. He also claimed excellent radio and wireless innovations.  He died penny-less.\n\nThere\'s a whole lot I didn\'t cover and a whole lot I still haven\'t.  Tesla only makes 5% of it\'s revenue from energy.  Just like I think it would be best for Tesla to do, I ignored it.', 'I disagree. Current valuations assume FANGs will gobble up any startup that threatens one of their businesses. With a truly split company this wouldn’t be as easy and there would be more room for disrupting one of the segments.', 'As a Tesla bear, I agree.  There’s a lot of poor speculation in the community.  \n\nThings like their constantly decreasing warranty reserve.  That’s to be expected with a new car company, the more cars you build the more often you get it right the first time.  \n\nSame with the “bankruptcy is right around the corner” bit.  Their Reg credits are extremely lucrative, and, at their current stock price, a 2.5% issuance would wipe away their debt.  \n\nHowever there are a few criticisms I think are legitimate:  \n\nThey have limited appeal outside the US.  A majority of sales in the EU come from Mini, small, and medium segments.  Tesla has nothing that fits in those, and they’re paying for it.  Tesla has an easy time with market penetration when they have no real competitors, but the Renault Zoe, e-golf, and e-tron are all already building market share, the ID series comes out 2021.  Tesla May have a medium competitor by 2022.  Still no rumors for a mini or small competitor.  Currently they have 8% euro EV market share.  For all the bulls saying “I’m still waiting for EV competitors,” the wait is over.  The Zoe is the best selling EV in Europe. \n\nThey sold 1500 cars in Japan in 2019.  They need Cheaper, smaller options to effectively compete in China, and they’ll have a hell of a time getting market penetration if CCP domestics get there first.  \n\nUp next:  The cybertruck.  It’s hideous.  The bed is small and has limited accessibility compared to a typical truck.  Additionally, Rivian plans to roll out their pickup before the cyber truck, and the potential capacity of their Normal, IL facility is nothing to sneeze at.  I also doubt the cybertruck will have greater appeal to pickup buyers than Ford’s upcoming offering.  It’s just a weird novelty item. \n\nAnd lastly, Self driving:  \n\nTesla’s self driving capabilities are way overhyped.  GM’s Cruise subsidiary is working on similar “Robotaxi” ideas.  So is Google’s Waymo, which already has operations in multiple cities.  Apple’s Drive.Ai is also gunning for that market. So are Lyft and Uber.  There are tons of innovative and well capitalized companies aiming for the AV market.  And, unlike Tesla, many already have approval for commercial self driving experiments.  Just because Tesla is the loudest, doesn’t mean they’re the best.  Even if they are the first, there is tons of competition and I anticipate the market will become a commoditized, low margin business.  The AV revolution -if it ever comes- will be a paradigm shift in transport cost.  You can’t compare Tesla’s potential margins on the business to traditional taxis or current Uber.  It will be a cutthroat competition of Uber, Lyft, Apple, Tesla, and others hemorrhaging money to try and build market share.\n\nAnd, as a thought experiment, let’s say Tesla’s autopilot system is ready for commercial use, and they’re the first ones ready.  They ask the EU if they can be roll it out.  Daimler, VW, Volvo, and Renault all then collectively nudge the EU and say “We think there may still be some unresolved issues, and our projects really aren’t that far away.”  It would be an absolute nightmare for Tesla to get approval outside domestic markets, especially when their are domestics in those markets who the regulators will undoubtedly favor.  They were, just recently, and successfully, sued for false advertising about their autopilot in Germany.  Google and Apple also have massive piles of cash they would gladly use for lobbying if it meant Tesla failed and they got time to catch up (though I don’t think Waymo is the one who needs to catch up, au contraire).  \n\nTesla is overhyped.  Their global market penetration is limited by their range of big sedan, bigger sedan, big SUV, and bigger SUV.  They won’t be first to the lucrative pickup market, and their offering is a total joke.  They’re autopilot is the loudest, not necessarily the best, and their 18:1 price to sales and 11:1 price to assets just aren’t justifiable.', ""I think we'll see AMD sales growth into 2021 and then it'll start dropping off. They have a strong foothold in both the cloud and game consoles. This will drive growth throughout next year unless other market factors influence it. \n\nGPCPUs are are threatened in general by companies making their own chips based on RISC-V or ARM as we can see with Apple's latest announcements and I think the market will eventually go that direction soon. The end of Moore's law is forcing software companies to start caring about silicon. As a result, the market will likely split into ISA and foundry segments with physical silicon becoming a commodity. Foundries will operate on thin margins similar to other asia manufacturers while ISAs will become a mix of open/semi open solutions mixed with proprietary vendor specific items (e.g. ML extensions or something similar).\n\nI could be wrong of course, but this seems to be the way things are heading."", ""What do you mean when you say 'tech bubble'?

Or they just download the game or buy it on Amazon and don\'t have to go out at all. Personally, I just see shopping in general - even before this current crisis, but moreso now as people increasingly want to go to one place and get everything. \n\nBurry talked up the next generation of consoles as if that will be Gamestop\'s savior.

Analyzing a company like 3M is a nightmare, because it's like analyzing 500 different disparate businesses.\n\nIf you're interested in healthcare diagnostics for instance, one of 3M's growth segments, you'd do much better just investing in someone like Danaher, who is much more focused, without having to worry about Scotch tape or sandpaper."", ""&gt; Plus full autonomy which is going to be a major breakthrough in Computer vision, AI, neural networks, deep learning, etc\n\nLots of companies working on full autonomy.   Tesla is not a clearcut leader in this space, at this stage we don't know who will.  \n  \n&gt;  Tesla's potential when combined with Boring tunnels   \n  \nWhat has been achieved?   It looks like they bought a boring machine and made a single tunnel.    The problem with tunnels is local governments acting like a mafia and everyone wanting a bribe to move things forward or block it with approvals.    I have not seen how Tesla will solve that issue.   \n  \n&gt; robotaxi fleet  \n  \nLet's see it successfully rolled out first.  \n   \nAnybody can talk about all the amazing tech they will roll out without any prototype yet.    But if you look at all the market segments you mention, Tesla today is worth more than the biggest player in each market combined.   That seems a little crazy."", 'Hiya. Actually, they\'re three great questions to ask! When people mention bonds, its usually low interest rate, government backed types or treasurys. \n\nInstead of holding bonds directly, I have them invested into several funds. My bank offers fractional entry at a minimum of $100 (for drips) or $1000 as a lump sum which makes things easier. I am outside the US, however, so YMMV.\n\nThe funds are in-line with my economic outlook, so they augment my investment portfolio as ""force multipliers"". As an individual investor, I cannot live without the support of mutual funds in order to maximize gain. Their expertise and computer systems work much faster than a human can.\n\nI generally buy into funds that focus on emerging market government debt, agency and non agency mortgage backed securities, chinese and US high yield corporates and junk bonds. Its erratic and there is diworsification, but there\'s no other way to churn out  3-5% yield and beat the negative rates of government bonds. \n\nBonds are definitely a long term holding for me, and I don\'t intend to sell them until retirement. When I began doing this in my early 20s, i\'d short stocks or FX trade on my phone whilst commuting, and a portion of my profits would be moved into bonds naturally.\n\nIn the event of a market dip - i.e. Feb-March 2020 - I would hold the bonds and preferably add to them, whilst following the Fed\'s liquidity infusion in lockstep.\n\nI hope the above answers your questions :o)\n\nPS- There is no such thing as a ""dumb"" question.', 'Lets use an example with exponential future potential. Heard of Sea Limited? I can buy ""future potential"" with triple digit rev. Growth, 3 high growth market segments in gaming, e-commerce and fintech. All with proven high GMs not promised future high GMs. Not to mention an ever expanding TAM with a leading market position in regions with trailing 5 year double digit cagr GDP growth. I can currently buy SEA for 12x NTM sales. Tesla? 15.4x NTM sales. That\'s what Tesla is currently trading at. At a more expensive valuation than a company which is consistently growing revs at %100+.', 'Closing my GME $5 calls on Friday sure backfired as I was just locking in some money...', 'Mostly since it’s impossible to make the judgment that certain companies won’t stop growing soon, so if you’re so sure of yourself then there’s no risk. More likely than not though, you’re using recency bias and can’t separate a good company from an expensive stock.', 'Jeez man good fucking call on GME. What else you got coming up lol', 'GME squeeze incoming...... and SE', 'Imagine being downvoted for stating the truth, fundamentally. Technically tesla wouldnt have been profitable the past four quarters had it not been for the carbon credit sales. As for stock price, im pretty sure it will go up, the demand is just too crazy and investors have the mindset as if tesla would still be the market leader in every segment in the next decade: auto/battery/solar etc. \n\nEven with giga shanghai running at max cap 250,000 units, the chinese market would be so saturated with evs by then i doubt tesla would be the market leader. Not to mention, the chinese government is planning to standardize batteries and is aiming to having battery swapping as an industry standard. (Imagine gas station like battery swapping stations throughout the whole country).', 'I watched this segment from Buffett on YouTube and didn’t fully understand it. You finally made me understand it. This is a great write up!']"
