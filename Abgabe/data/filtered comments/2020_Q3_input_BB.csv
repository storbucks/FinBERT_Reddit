This fund has been consistently one of the best ETFs over a long period of time and consistently outperforms the S&amp;P 500.\n\n$1000 in **ICLN** \\- **ICLN** is an ETF that invests in renewable, clean energy companies. I believe that clean, renewable energy is definitely the future, and this fund is one that I\'ve been invested in. It has been a very solid performer and my feeling is that after the first of the year, if the elections go the way I think they might go, this fund could really take off.

Might update this if I get the time to rewrite it. Laugh if you will but for valuations and where the market stands I like morningstar( https://www.morningstar.com/market-fair-value )Below is just a few cents on the subject and are just my opinions:\n\nYou’re actually right that we don’t know for a fact what the earnings impact will be and that Q2 and Q3 will be showing. Q2 is much more important because its likely to be earnings bottom. Markets are about expectations and if its below expected then we will correct accordingly(contrary to what reddit would have you believe the Fed didn’t eat the markets whole). \n\nI would advise an abundance of caution in investing before a vaccine is available. I will feel a lot more confident the first quarter after a vaccine because I know its only up from there. Also my investment strategy doesnt care too much about the yearly return of the underlying stock so I don’t need to bargain hunt, I just need to be safe so have a bit of a bias there and its why I advise caution.\n\nThere is also some political risk, if Biden gets in corporate tax rate will get upped by 7% leading to a 3-4% decrease in earnings(effective tax is lower than the increase on paper). While its unlikely Id be careful holding onto Amazon/Facebook past elections. If dems get the government they might feel confident bringing forward an anti trust case or/and getting some concession. Either way they will experience some volatility.\n\nI will personally buy after both the election/vaccine but will not sell any of my current holdings just because a correction is likely(since I think any correction will be short lived so long as we get a vaccine, if we don’t get a vaccine its kind of gg).', ""As much as I'd like to see Tesla's bubble pop, betting against it hasn't been a great idea for years now.

Grattis! \n\nI want to point out  to the ones who don\'t live in Sweden how hard it is to save money here, specially for someone of the OP\'s age. I have friends in their 30s and 40s, who have relatively good jobs,  that don\'t have even a  50K to their name (if you don\'t count the amount of money they will have if they sell their house/apartment/car etc). There seems to be 100% trust in the system, even those that are at OP\'s age, as if the whole Swedish system will be intact in 40-50 years from now and everyone will get their pension, will keep getting their free health care, etc. Yeah, the free health care (even though it is really crappy, unless you have a serious problem like cancer), the mandatory pension, quite good parental leaves, etc... make more people end up living check to check, maybe saving a little to be spent during the relatively generous 5 to 7 weeks of holidays. You can clearly see this where restaurants and bars are full the last weekend of the month (salary here is paid usually on the 25th), and rather empty the weekend before.  \n\nThe whole system is geared towards keeping you stuck at working until the age of 65, or maybe 75 by the time when OP retires. Yes, I agree, reasonable and more humane working conditions than that of US, Korea, Japan, etc... but on the other hand, more dangerous in a way, because, you are kept in this ""comfy"" prison of wage slavery, that is extremely well guarded through heavy taxation and extreme ""flattening"" of the salary curve (e.g. in most companies,  most of the yearly salary increase is not at an individual level. If you are graded to have performed exceptionally well, you may get 1 to 2% more than the average,  and the average is like 2-3% to begin with). Basically, working people in Sweden seem to be ""comfortably numb"".\n\nSo congrats for not getting caught in the same trap, and if you continue this way and stay careful on not falling for get rich quick day trading schemes, you can easily be financially independent before turning 30. Then you can work, travel,  go back to school (one big advantage here, you don\'t have to pay shit), be a beach bum somewhere, whatever rocks your boat. Of course, it goes without saying that you shouldn\'t overwork and stress yourself to death to reach that goal. But sacrificing  some years of your life for shaping your destiny is definitely worth it.  \n\nAnd look around you, you are not missing that much. Most guys your age are getting drunk almost every weekend, renting an apartment in Sodermalm/Vasastan/Ostermalm (paying half or more of their salary for it), spending the rest  on eating out almost every day, buying stuff they can\'t afford, etc... You can still live a great life without following the norm and without spending all your money. There are tons of hobbies that are basically for free (running, outdoor gyms, books,  ...) , pick one or more and entertain yourself that way. You don\'t need dozens of friends to party with, pick 3 to 5 that you regularly meet and have a deep connection with. And thanks to the universal usage/acceptance of dating apps like Tinder here, you don\'t need to go to clubs/bars to meet girls (maybe you have to reconsider living on your own in the near future).\n\nSome people below have suggested you should travel while you are still young, etc... I agree, if you wait until you are 50 to save enough money before you can start traveling, then that is a shame. However, at 30, you will be as strong or even stronger and full of energy than at 20, if you have led a good life.   Also, you will be wiser and will enjoy traveling much more then, trust me. \n\nOnce again congratulations on your success so far and wish you the best!\n\nLycka til!', ""I was/am a huge long.

I would assume that if we were near to such a thing then the Fed would be buying at least tens of billions of dollars worth of corporate bonds but so far from what I have seen they have only bought a few billion dollars worth(unless I am grossly mistaken) which is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the entire amount of corporate debt out there.

There is a natural tendency for asset deflation which will and must be met with Fed printing. As the Fed prints to reinflate these asset bubbles they are at even greater risk of deflating once stimulus is removed. Ever increasing amounts of stimulus are required with each cycle. The Fed is trapped and this will end in hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is very similar to deflation and not simply an extension of inflation as most think. Hyperinflation simply represents the monetary response to severe deflation as people come to lose faith in the currency and opt to shift wealth into hard assets.

There are a LOT of ETFs out there that will outperform the S&amp;P 500 most years. That\'s the main criteria I use when evaluating ETFs. Aside from that specific criteria, I look for ETFs that have exposure to different companies so that I\'m more diversified. Consider the following:\n\n**QQQ** \\- Nasdaq index fund; tech heavy; lots of companies, many the same as VOO, but it does outperform **VOO**\n\n**VOOG** \\- Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth Index. This one is very similar to **QQQ** in performance. It takes the S&amp;P 500 companies and strips out those that aren\'t growth focused.  (Mimics the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index, specifically). **SPYG** is very similar.\n\n**THNQ** \\- This is a newer ETF and has not been around long enough to compare to the S&amp;P 500. However it has outperformed the S&amp;P and **QQQ** for the past few months that I\'ve owned shares in it. It is an ETF focused on companies that work in Robotics and AI; although they define that loosely, so think of it as a specialized Tech ETF. Similar ETFs include: **GDAT**, **WUGI**, **ROBT**, **BLCN** and **IVES**.\n\n**ICLN** \\- iShares Clean Renewable Energy ETF. Another ""Sector"" ETF (like **THNQ**), only this one focused on Renewable energy sources. Again, another solid performer; adds diversity to your ETF portfolio. Matches or outperforms S&amp;P most years. Similar ETFs include **TAN**, **PBW**, **PIO**\n\n**IDNA** \\- iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF. Another Sector ETF. This ETF has absolutely blown away the S&amp;P 500 since March. It has been similar in performance to the S&amp;P 500 over the past 2 year and 5 year time frames. ETFs similar to this one include: **IBB**, **CNCR**, **GDNA**, **SBIO**, **HTEC** and **ARKG**.\n\n**ARKG** \\- ARK\'s Genomic Revolution ETF. See **IDNA** above. Very similar in performance.\n\n**XLY** \\- SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Fund. A fund of the better retail companies. This fund allows you to diversify into the retail sector. It has slightly outperformed the S&amp;P 500, but hasn\'t blown it away. It\'s highly rated as it\'s not extremely volatile and invests in ""safe"" companies. Similar funds include: **VCR**, **FDIS**, **JHMC**, **IEDI**, **RCD**\n\n**IWF** \\- iShares Trust Russell 1000 Index Fund. This fund is a benchmark fund designed to mimic the Russell 1000 Index. It has also performed significantly better than the S&amp;P 500 over the past 6 months, 2 years and 5 years. Similar Funds include: **VONG**, **RWGV**, **IWY**, **IUSG**, **IVW**\n\n**XITK** \\- SPDR Factset Innovative Technology ETF. This fund may be one of the best performing funds of the past 4 months as well as the past 5 years. Over the 5 year time period, the return of **XITK** has been more than 3 times that of the S&amp;P 500.

Similar funds include: **WCLD**, **OGIG**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **PNQI**\n\nFunds that I have listed as ""Similar Funds"" are funds with similar goals and invested in similar sectors, but not necessarily similar performance.

They fluctuate less than almost any  other things in their cost of production. And from their durability, the  total quantity in existence is at all times so great in proportion to  the annual supply, that the effect on value even of a change in the cost  of production is not sudden; a very long time being required to  diminish materially the quantity in existence, and even to increase it  greatly not being a rapid process.

Many experts have actually compared retail trader/investor activity in 2Q20 to the Dot Com bubble in 2000 and 2001. I agree with them strongly on this comparison, and think it\'s important to remember that there is *a lot* of money on the sidelines right now, particularly on the institutional side. Market prices are about where they were prior to the COVID crisis (at least for large-cap companies, particularly those in SPY and many tech companies traded on the NASDAQ), and many analysts and investment professionals believed that valuations were high *before* we had a massive economic shock. This observation has not been forgotten by institutions with billions on the sidelines right now, and I believe once the reality of economic health sets in a little more firmly and a correction ensues, there will could be more liquidity shocks driven less by increased selling pressure and more by a lack of demand for these companies viewed by institutions as being mispriced. When the Fed held a press conference in June and reiterated that the economic recovery could be an extended process, that simple reality (that really should not have been a surprise to anyone) was enough to drive the S&amp;P 500 lower by over 100 points and drive VIX up 40% in a single day. In my opinion that could be an indication of how little desire there is to buy into equities at their current valuations.\n\nThe good news for us is that we\'re young and we have plenty of time until retirement, so near-term shocks and downturns shouldn\'t impact our ability to retire comfortably unless we\'re haphazardly investing every spare cent the entire time. Given the monumental uncertainty between now and 2021, I might not allocate my money into anything else outside gold and rebalance post-election. My short-term indicators I\'ll be watching will really only guide some swing trades I make after hours, as I won\'t feel confident parking my money anywhere long-term until fundamentals start working their way back into equity valuations.\n\nRegarding your inquiry about ""balance"" in investing versus targeting growth stocks, refer back to what I said about the 2020 ""pain trade"": *everyone* crowded into these stocks, as they were often the best-positioned stocks to perform well given the crisis being faced. This was due to the ""TINA"" principle, which is to say ""there is no alternative"". Not everyone wanted to park their cash in one place, but there was no better option with interest rates near zero, bond yields at record lows and QE infinity by the Fed to provide a backstop to equity prices. Once opportunities arise in other industries, equity prices will begin correcting in certain areas that have been crowded (think tech) and you may see price surges in industries that have been depressed (think airlines in recent weeks). This is why I want to do that research now: to figure out where the value will be once the dust settles.\n\nFor reference: I am in my mid twenties with a fair amount of savings, and I actually have very high risk tolerance. I have roughly $30k on the sidelines right now, $8k in gold holdings and about $60k in long-term Vanguard funds covering large, mid, and small-cap stocks. I will not touch the $60k in Vanguard funds until I retire, and intend to manage the ~$40k myself actively.\n\n**tl;dr**: Don\'t count on dumb money becoming smart, rather DCA into the market during pullbacks. If the SPY sells off 100 points again in a single day, throw some of your money at it and let it ride. You\'ll likely get burned timing a bottom like everyone else who didn\'t buy into the March lows, and with there being very few alternatives to earn a good ROI in the market right now, it\'s difficult to advise moving your money elsewhere. Gold is certainly my favorite asset right now, but I\'ll hopefully have some more insights after this weekend that will include new holding recommendations. I don\'t think we\'ll re-test the March lows with the Fed as a backstop for markets unless, and I can\'t stress this enough, **everything goes to hell**. And unless Yellowstone erupts, I don\'t really see how things could get much worse in the near-term. Mid-long term is more concerning to me.\n\nIf you want to participate in the market but are worried about downside risks, you could always buy protective puts on your assets as well to limit your losses.

The lower the interest rate the greater future earnings are ""baked"" into the price of the stock. At high interest rates the more you need to discount that future cash flow. You are not simply buying into the economy for a single year at that singular GDP, but rather you are buying the corporate earnings of the economy for every single year into the future as well.\n\nWhen interest rates are historically low like they have been recently the change in the interest rate and by extension a change in how much future earnings you can bake into the price can have more impact on the price of the asset than a temporary drop in earnings can. Let\'s say it takes 3 years for the economy to get back to where it was before the recession, what that effectively means is that 3 years of anticipated growth has been wiped out. At low interest rates that actually doesn\'t matter all that much because you can basically wait forever and not be losing all that much.\n\nAt 0.75% interest rates, earnings in 3 years are only discounted at 2.6% lower than earnings today would be, so in effect you have a lot more time to wait to recoup your lost earnings with such low rates. When the 10 year federal government bond was 5% in 2000 and 2007, earnings in 3 years would only be discounted by 15.8%. Taken together what this means is if you think the GDP will recover in 3 years, with 0.75% interest rates you should only pay 97.4% what you would have before, but at 5% interest rates you should pay 84.2% what you would have before to get your cut of the US economy.\n\nOkay so lets say we assume the market over corrects as well as it over anticipates before the crash, so lets take where the S&amp;P500 was before the official start of the recession and then take where it looks like it stabilizes after the dip and rebound.\n\nFeb 2001 was 1240, stabilized at  1140 in February 2004. which is 8% loss from technical start of recession to stabilization of the market. If we count from peak in August 2000 at 1520 to stabilization that is a 25% loss, are the 3.5 years it took to get with 5% discounting is 18.6%.\n\nLittle known fact the recession in 2008 actually started in 2007, its just people seemed to not notice until the crash. The peak in October 2007 was 1550, while the stabilization was October of 2009. Technically the economy actually did shrink for a single quarter in 2010 but that technically didn\'t count as a recession, but if we include that we could consider the stabilization point as October of 2010 which gives us a nice round 3 years. By that time it was 1180, which is a 23.8% loss over 3 years.\n\nIn both cases it appears as if the market stabilized 25% lower than its peak, although it took longer for that to happen following the dotcom bubble than the housing bubble. At 5% discounting those 3-3.5 lost years are worth 15-20%. All in all the markets seems to have valued those lost years more or less what the interest rate says it was worth. Now we\'ve gone from a peak of 3390 to a stabilization of about 3100, which is 8.6% loss. If we account for the fact that in the housing and dotcom bubble ended up about 5% lower than my model expected them to be, then an 8.6% accounts approximately for that as well as 2.6% discounting over 3 years while recovering.

Many analysts focused on aspects of individual businesses that had nothing to do with *how* they generated revenue or their cash flow. For example, one theory is that the Internet bubble burst due to a preoccupation with the “network theory,” which stated the value of a network increased exponentially as the series of nodes (computers hosting the network) increased. Although this concept made sense, it neglected one of the most important aspects of valuing the network: the ability of the company to use the network to generate cash and produce profits for investors.\n2. **Significantly Overvalued Stocks**. In addition to focusing on unnecessary metrics, analysts used very high multipliers in their models and formulas for valuing Internet companies, which resulted in unrealistic and overly optimistic values. Although more conservative analysts disagreed, their recommendations were virtually drowned out by the overwhelming hype in the financial community around Internet stocks. \n\nDo your DD on the dot com bubble then you will probably end up withdrawing lots of your positions.

There are a LOT of ETFs out there that will outperform the S&amp;P 500 most years. That\'s the main criteria I use when evaluating ETFs. Aside from that specific criteria, I look for ETFs that have exposure to different companies so that I\'m more diversified. Consider the following:\n\n**QQQ** \\- Nasdaq index fund; tech heavy; lots of companies, many the same as VOO, but it does outperform **VOO**\n\n**VOOG** \\- Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Growth Index. This one is very similar to **QQQ** in performance. It takes the S&amp;P 500 companies and strips out those that aren\'t growth focused. (Mimics the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index, specifically). **SPYG** is very similar.\n\n**THNQ** \\- This is a newer ETF and has not been around long enough to compare to the S&amp;P 500. However it has outperformed the S&amp;P and **QQQ** for the past few months that I\'ve owned shares in it. It is an ETF focused on companies that work in Robotics and AI; although they define that loosely, so think of it as a specialized Tech ETF. Similar ETFs include: **GDAT**, **WUGI**, **ROBT**, **BLCN** and **IVES**.\n\n**ICLN** \\- iShares Clean Renewable Energy ETF. Another ""Sector"" ETF (like **THNQ**), only this one focused on Renewable energy sources. Again, another solid performer; adds diversity to your ETF portfolio. Matches or outperforms S&amp;P most years. Similar ETFs include **TAN**, **PBW**, **PIO**\n\n**IDNA** \\- iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF. Another Sector ETF. This ETF has absolutely blown away the S&amp;P 500 since March. It has been similar in performance to the S&amp;P 500 over the past 2 year and 5 year time frames. ETFs similar to this one include: **IBB**, **CNCR**, **GDNA**, **SBIO**, **HTEC** and **ARKG**.\n\n**ARKG** \\- ARK\'s Genomic Revolution ETF. See **IDNA** above. Very similar in performance.\n\n**XLY** \\- SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Fund. A fund of the better retail companies. This fund allows you to diversify into the retail sector. It has slightly outperformed the S&amp;P 500, but hasn\'t blown it away. It\'s highly rated as it\'s not extremely volatile and invests in ""safe"" companies. Similar funds include: **VCR**, **FDIS**, **JHMC**, **IEDI**, **RCD**\n\n**IWF** \\- iShares Trust Russell 1000 Index Fund. This fund is a benchmark fund designed to mimic the Russell 1000 Index. It has also performed significantly better than the S&amp;P 500 over the past 6 months, 2 years and 5 years. Similar Funds include: **VONG**, **RWGV**, **IWY**, **IUSG**, **IVW**\n\n**XITK** \\- SPDR Factset Innovative Technology ETF. This fund may be one of the best performing funds of the past 4 months as well as the past 5 years. Over the 5 year time period, the return of **XITK** has been more than 3 times that of the S&amp;P 500. The fund is a Sector fund focused on newer technologies, especially (but not exclusively) cloud based technologies. Similar funds include: **WCLD**, **OGIG**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **PNQI**\n\nFunds that I have listed as ""Similar Funds"" are funds with similar goals and invested in similar sectors, but not necessarily similar performance. In fact, two different ETFs focused in the same sector often have wildly different results. Most index funds that mimic a specific index will have very similar performance.\n\nHope this helps. If you investigate ALL of these ETFs, you\'ll probably be busy for a few weeks. Feel free to ask specific questions about them if you can\'t find an answer. I don\'t have all the answers, but I\'ll try to be helpful.\n\nDisclaimer: I own shares in all of the funds I\'ve listed in at the beginning of each paragraph, but not funds I\'ve listed as ""Similar Funds.""', 'Asshole award goes to this guy.

The consensus targets I\'m hearing are at least 2k gold, although some think gold could retreat to 1600-1700 short term before getting up there.  \n\nI\'m basically in for a chunk and planning my next moves.  If gold does drop heavy I expect to get to at least 60% gold in my trading account quickly.  If it keeps going up maybe slowly add on individual stock dips to at least 40% of my account.\n\nMy current concerns that lead me to think gold is going to continue up(and probably silver too): (oh and i\'m definitely not an expert)\n\n\\-Election talk is leading away from Trump right now, which means democrats, removing the corporate taxes that help, and wall street is talking about this too which means prices are dropping, expectations are droppings.  Stopping the tax cuts means the buy backs of stock by companies will decrease or stop and they have severely contributed to past returns, so I expect much lower returns going forward if the dems win.

Maybe it will crash, maybe the fund managers will rebalance out of it and into value like they sometimes do, who knows.  The only thing I know is i\'m terrified of it.  oh, and I started investing in the tech bubble, which means tech bit me bad back then, so yeah I probably am easily scared by tech valuations.\n\n\\-the Euphoria I\'m seeing in investing right now, way too many people are doing crazy things, too many new people, with way too high expections, eventually these things are going to backfire.  For example I made a killing on NKLA, knowing that people would consider it the next Tesla and the price would rocket....I have no idea what the company should be valued at, I just knew it would ""moon"" once it went public due to the current environment.  Also, everyone expects to make 100% right now on any trade it\'s just crazy.  Betting on SPAC\'s is almost easy money, in my opinion another example of euphoria.\n\n\\-Covid concerns, clearly America is not doing a good job as it is still spreading, we are going to be dealing with this for a long time.  Also, hope for a vaccine is carrying many people but it could 1. easily be 6 months away, 2. may only last for 3 to 6 months, no one really knows yet.  also, half the country is unemployed.\n\n\\-luckily I have  made enough to be better off than when the crash hit in March and I feel lucky about that.  I can lose out on more gains this year if gold doesn\'t do too much and still be ok.  \n\nOK, that\'s all I got, hopefully it was coherent.

It’s no coincidence that the rapid rise of EVs has aligned with the creation and rise of Tesla.', 'Trying to keep this as short and concise, but to literally answer every one of your points:\n\n- There is a statistically very high probability the first sentence is no longer true in &lt; 3 weeks when earnings is announced and can never be used again\n\n- Every company has debt - what’s wrong with borrowing money if you can use it for a higher future return than you’ve borrowed it for?\n\n- Tesla leads the industry in margins, and their margins will get to the point where they blow your mind (especially non-car margins) \n\n- Tesla is NOT being priced to have a 50% market share. They’ve very clearly stated they do not plan to do this alone. Their mission statement is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, not be the world’s only sustainable energy source. They know and WILL need the help of all big auto to go electric as the world goes all electric. They want/need ford, GM, Audi, and BMW to make electric cars. Tesla currently has a 17% market share in electric vehicles today, and all reputable analysis assumes this % will drop in projections by at least a third (even though it still hasn’t). Way smaller figure than 50%\n\n- From what I understand, comparing to Waymo is apples to oranges. Tesla is working toward coast to coast full self driving, Cali to NY. Waymo’s engineers have to go to the field to completely 3D map any area the car wants to drive in first (which it does do very well). Completely different goals and approach \n\n- Amazon and Microsoft do have a great chance to succeed in FSD, I hope they start to show it\n\n- Once you’ve driven a Tesla, you will quickly understand their moat, unless you’re a tech averse boomer. I hate to shock you, but there’s a reason there were 90000 Tesla’s delivered to customers during a pandemic. All without advertising, a factory shut down for half the quarter, and an increase from Q1, when ford and GM are facing unfathomable declines. People love their product. Look at the iPhone in 2007 for reference. Throw a few gigafactories coming in the next years (money printer facilities), battery tech, high demand, Tesla Energy, a future ride hailing platform, and you have a great deal of moat\n\nTesla is not a bubble because it simply has the potential to be one of the largest market caps in the world, and investors are realizing this. I don’t care if you believe they will or not, 99.9% of companies do not possess this potential room to grow. I understand you may want to debate any of the points above, but I will not respond, as there’s nothing in it for me to convince you further at this point. I deeply encourage you to start doing your own research, both bear and bull cases, so you can gain the conviction to invest in Tesla sooner rather than later. It’s okay to change views if presented with different facts, the biggest egos in investing will miss out on the most. Dips will come, perhaps large ones at times, but that does not change the potentiation of one day becoming the worlds largest company, and how much there is to accomplish during that journey to get there', 'The thing is, even if it is a bubble, you are missing all the points. \n\nTesla has the potential for bigger margin and profits than other automakers simply because they are vertically integrated (doesn\'t rely on thousands of suppliers coordination to get a new car or feature out) and do not depend on dealers to sell its vehicles that eat out a big chunk of the vehicle sale profit and almost all of the servicing revenue. Being a ""small"" company is really and advantage while the world is in a transisition to electric mobility.\n\nThen, despite of what you said regarding full self driving, they are years ahead of the competition if you consider the cost basis. Waymo may be close but they use a ugly and expensive LiDAR to get to it while Tesla only uses vision and has the biggest huge dataset in the world (that is always increasing with every mile driven by its costumers) and is already deploying beta versions of FSD to its costumers over-the-air while 99.99999% of other other automakers\' cars doesn\'t even support ota updates (Tesla does since 2012!)\n\nAnd, they are not even a car manufacturer only, they have a strong and growing business in solar energy and storage. They have even a symbiotic relationship with SpaceX the current leader in space technology.\n\nThey can fail yes, anything can go wrong, but I wouldn\'t bet against them with only mouth-to-mouth arguments. Try to understand and research why is everyone so invested in Tesla instead of making these sad posts.', ""It's an electric vehicle bubble.

It's actually a fairly risky stock in my book. I don't hold a position at the moment but would consider it if it dropped sharply. \n\nBut regarding other car manufacturers:\n\nBeing 'first to market' doesn't always mean you'll always be first. Tesla have spent hundreds of millions of dollars, probably billions, developing this tech that noone else wants to put up the cash for. They've kick-started the industry, but now they have to lead it.\n\nThe problem is that they need to be *so* far ahead that noone can catch them for decades. Right now, you could say that no other car manufacturer is anywhere near competing with Tesla, not on cars, not on battery tech, not on self-driving, and definitly not on charging infrastructure, which is massivly sub-par at the moment. I own a Tesla and can attest to this. The supercharger network is the only way to travel long distance in an EV right now, and only Teslas can use this.\n\nOther car manufacturers are starting to build EVs, but all of them are expensive, and have less features than Tesla offer right now. The new VW ID3 is expensive for essentially a futuristic styled electric Golf. It costs £27,500 to £39,000. £39 grand! A Tesla Model 3 is £37,800 and WAY better equipped. \n\nHowever, this huge gap could close pretty quick, being that these car manufacturers have huge amounts of money and 100 years of automobile manufacturing infrastructure behind them. So it makes it a bit of a gamble - do you invest heavily in Tesla now becuase you think they will still be the market leader in 10 years time? Or will another manufacturer ride the wave of EV tech that Tesla has started, leaving Tesla in the dust."", '&gt; Please explain to me why this valuation is not a bubble? \n\nIt is. Tesla is a good company and Musk is a genius, but neither of them are worth $1,000+ per share.', ""It is a bubble. It just isn't worth what its labeled at. Not worth half the current price I reckon.\n\nDoesn't mean you can't profit from this bubble if you so choose\n\nJust ensure you quit while you're ahead 👍"", ""I agree with all of the above, except that you can put your money into fixed income funds/high yield bond funds and generate some decent returns instead of sitting in cash. \n\nI definitely agree that going into US stocks at the height of a fed-inflated bubble isn't a great idea. Most analysts agree that the US isn't going to see much growth/recovery in the 2nd half of 2020 and so you'd just be riding a pure bubble."", 'Sure, but if Tesla wants to grow they need new customers.

Lots of debt there and if Trump isn't reelected, what we see today will be peak China. There is a reckoning about to occur.

There\'s countless articles on SeekingAlpha in recent years trying to call the top in various growth stocks, but they\'re always missing one thing: a catalyst. Someone can say something is expensive, it\'s another thing to say ""this is expensive and (reason why it will run into distress in the near-term; new competition, whatever.)', 'Hexo seem hugely undervalued currently. The whole sector seems to be hugely undervalued compared to the current bubble forming in the market with other sectors, and I think Hexo are a good play as it is by far the most undervalued with huge potential. Especially with their Molson Coors deal, and their sales license for their Belleville facility (looks like this is where they will be producing their drinks so I expect big news from that soon.) \n\nTheir recent earnings report also shows they could be EBITDA positive before you think. Q2 was a horrible for them which really ran down the price, but this is mostly due to them taking a hit early to pave the way for a profitable 2021. \n\nA market cap of 320 million (HEXO) when companies like Nio (11 billion) and NKLA (20 billion), when both companies are unprofitable and way more speculative, is crazy to me. Nio doesnt even own its own production and outsources the manufacturing of their cars, and NKLA has 0 revenue. At least hexo has a market, owns its own factories and production, and has a proven market and signs of growth.\n\nI\'ll be picking up shares until October (US elections are likely to make most cannabis stocks overpriced - I may buy more if Trump wins.) and then holding until their Q1 2021 earnings to see if they were able to pull it off. This could be the comeback story the sector needs, and could lead to HEXO being on track to be market leaders in Canada, and a big player in the American drinks market with the help of Coors. \n\nPeople where saying very similar things about Tesla being a dead company before it started its growth story. I think Hexo and the cannabis market as a whole will be one to watch in 2021 and beyond now that a lot of the foundations have been laid and the markets are picking up in Canada.\n\nThe main point you see against Hexo is ""I lost money on this stock"" - past performance is not indicative of future results, and cannabis stock used to be hugely overvalued. Their negative points are now mostly priced in, with the future looking pretty positive imo.', "" Just generally what do you suggest a young person's investing habbits should be and what investments should they be considering?"", 'I think tech is going to keep growing  and leading the market.

Either way a lump sum investment in the next 2-4 weeks is probably not a good idea. \n\nHowever, for most investors (myself included) timing the market is generally a bad idea and the best way to make money is by continuingly investing periodically every month when you are paid for years and years.

You should also mix in a small amount of cash, gold (we're talking 5%, if you want to bet on crypto then a small amount of BTC or another metal may be a good idea if your young but this is polarising and should be left to your discretion), bonds (less bonds when younger, more when reaching retirement). The younger you are the more of your portfolio you can dedicate to hail Marys or more specialized ETFs (ie NASDAQ, single companies or 'picked' stocks). In short, the low variance way to get rich over many years is to constantly invest broadly in a boring portfolio taking into account your age, risk tolerance, job security etc. \n\nOne thought I might add to all of this is that half the people here are part of the genuine DCA crowd, they've done it for years and will continue to do it through the ups and downs.

The same thing happened during the BTC bubble where people were saying buy now why does it matter what happens in the short term if you believe the price will be higher in 10 years? Now obviously crypto is different but the psychology is the same. If you go all in on tech today and there is a downturn (which is completely possible) are you willing to buy more as you watch your portfolio drop?

It appears they\'d identify vulnerable or small companies, and produce reports that would manipulate stock prices (I think pump and dump more refers to them buying a lot of stock, giving favorable information so the stock jumps, and then selling the stock for a high profit, but this can easily work the other way around).\n\nA HUGE red flag, is that Hindenburg Research isn\'t even a true research company, as again stated in SeekingAlpha.\n\n\\&gt; ""But facts aren’t their game. They are simply a publisher of strong opinions. [Hindenburg’s Twitter bio](https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1278308941676646401) reads: “Popping bubbles as we see them. We express strong opinions. Not investment advice.”\n\nThe fact that they can manipulate IDEX\'s stock by a report like this is frightening. Even though I\'m a novice, it seems to speak to the fact that IDEX\'s gains are not based on much fundamental or value.\n\nJ Capital seems (again at a cursory glance) to be reputable, or at least marginally so.\n\nFinally, the bigger issue is here:\n\nIDEX appears to mainly operate in China, which is a very very different animal, especially around investing and understanding how a business operates in China vs say in the US.\n\nThe seeking alpha article points to possible issues around language translation and not knowing how business is done, and HOW to request data from certain Chinese agencies as potential culprits in why this is ongoing.\n\nUnless you have good knowledge of China, how businesses operate in China, and more information than I could find on IDEX and willingness to do your own footwork between China and where-ever else they do business, IDEX isn\'t for anybody, or at least not you or I, as this is a ""he said, she said"" spat that\'s not good for anybody unless they know who is going to fire the next volley, and from what direction.', 'I’m no expert, but I think we are in the beginning of an asset bubble with assistance from the Fed and the government.

The Fed took historically unprecedented action to save the economy. So you can thank the federal reserve not Obama. The economy grew, anemically, despite Obama not because of him. Trends don’t just continue indefinitely.\n\nObama inherited a disastrously deteriorating economy and financial crisis and he wasn't a financial policy heavyweight that had influence before he came into office. That means that he's neither to blame for the situation nor is he to be praised for the big rebound in stocks because they had crashed to dramatic lows and had a big rebound built into that crash. But he didn't stand in the way of stimulus and fed bailouts with a lot of dysfunctional political agendas, but on the other hand he also didn't do a lot of things he should have done for individual homeowners. The HAARP program which was supposed to help underwater mortgage holders, that lenders agreed to as a condition for their bailouts, was unenforceable as banks trampled all over homeowners' rights under HAARP and forced hundreds of thousands of unnecessary foreclosures. In that sense, by doing nothing as the foreclosures steamrolled individual homeowners and their rights/benefits under HAARP, Obama is responsible for the massive debt overhang that dragged on the economy for most of his presidency and dragged down millennials for much of their lives. On the other hand, he's done nothing that a Republican president was unlikely to do, since they also favor banks, corps and feed them huge profits in stimulus situations. I seriously doubt a Republican president would have enforced HAARP rights at the expense of the banks who were enriched by the bailout and wanted to scalp more money from homeowners by foreclosing on underwater mortgages more than they wanted to honor their agreements to refinance those mortgages. Economic inequality increased under Obama's stimulus just as economic inequality has increased under Trump's stimulus, with big business and wealthy people making out much better than regular people and lower income people suffering setbacks. So stimulus and fed actions are equally flawed under both parties, as far as I can tell, when it comes to economic fundamentals for growth and stability that depend on consumers being financially stable (in 2009 or 2020).\n\n&gt; Growth accelerated when the Rs won in 2016 despite the Federal Reserve raising rates and us approaching full employment. It becomes exponentially more difficult to grow the economy under those conditions. We got immediate feedback from hiring business owners/managers when the Rs got elected that their confidence levels were suddenly at 17 years highs and they began hiring more people to meet increased expected demand for their goods and services.\n\nConfidence is a big factor in business decisions, as well as there being less uncertainty in the business environment, because both factor into businesses having enough confidence for capital investment and hiring, for sure. Trump has been good for that and was consistent re: taxes and deregulation. However, his trade wars have created a lot of uncertainty and economic headwinds at a time when we had enjoyed some ongoing growth from the last households that were emerging from the 2007-2009 mortgage debt overhang and he could have coasted on that for a while instead of becoming a disruptor. Presumably, there's some winning scenario in his trade war and disruptions of trade alliances, but I haven't figured out what that is yet. Trump also never extricated us from the low-interest-rate stimulus, so we were in an artificially inflated state that started to collapse as soon as the Fed tried to normalize interest rates and he railed and the Fed every time it tried to raise rates. In part, what Trump was leveraging was an economic lift from the tail end of households emerging from the debt overhang of the mortgage derivatives crisis and a loose money policy that was never fully ended by the Fed. The latter is artificial growth that might be concealing huge downsides in which a massive collapse of inflated equity prices might be lurking. So Trump has gotten a lot of growth out of the recovery from 2009, but his never ending the stimulus might have the planted the seeds of inflated markets and a stock market bubble. If the stock market we are in today never collapses like a bubble, then he was successful. If it does collapse, then he's probably the one at fault for pushing for never-ending Fed stimulus.\n&gt; From Wikipedia Leading indicators Leading indicators are indicators that usually, but not always, change before the economy as a whole changes.[1] They are therefore useful as short-term predictors of the economy. Stock market returns are a leading indicator: the stock market usually begins to decline before the economy as a whole declines and usually begins to improve before the general economy begins to recover from a slump. Other leading indicators include the index of consumer expectations, building permits, and the money supply.\n\nThank you.\n\n&gt; In Google finance you can track S&amp;P 500 growth from Nov 2016 to today.\n&gt; Unemployment rate is a coincident indicator and is at a 50 year low.

It seems to me that there was a growth curve under Obama as households slowly emerged from the ""household debt overhang"" of mortages that were underwater in the late 2000\'s, and that growth curve was still full swing when Trump took office. So we were riding that growth from households getting out from under the housing bubble debt, and then at some point a couple of years into the Trump presidency, it started to run out of steam and stabilize and then his trade war with China, Canada and Mexico started taking a real toll on the economy, as far as I recall.\n\nBut whether or not that would have happened with or without Trump, is a question if we\'re comparing Democrats to Republicans.

BRRR assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans). Things can go wrong and you don't have a way to pay the hard money back. This is not for inexperienced investors unless you have your own money or another way to pay the loan if things don't go right .\n\nOthers recommend not putting more than 5% down when purchasing a property. Being heavily in debt is not a good idea when there is a crisis and you still have bills to pay but no income . It's better to have 20-40% per property.\n\nLastly HCOL markets rarely have properties that follow the 1% rule (monthly rent is 1% of purchase price) but have the possibility of appreciation.

They have not been able to move beyond their current 10nm process, despite a lot of trying.  Their main market, PCs, has been stagnant or in decline.  They\'re trying, but they don\'t seem to be able to enter other markets.  A lot of the OEMs are now selling PCs with AMD processors, which did not happen when AMD had the best chip in the 00s.\n\nThat having been said, I am long Intel, and do not own AMD or NVIDIA stock.  I think AMD and NVIDIA are excellent companies, but they might be overpriced.  \n\nI have a lot of confidence Intel are going to turn it around, just like they have every other time they\'ve been behind.  They did it when DEC had the Alpha, and AMD had the first x64 chip.  I just don\'t think it\'s going to be quick or soon, and a lot of institutional investors likely don\'t want to wait a year or two to see how things shake out.  (""Being early is the same as being wrong"")  It will be interesting to see what happens in 2021 when they should have their new fab setup.\n\nThere is also a lot of discussion about the problems with letting TSMC create most of the world\'s chips.  AMD and NVidia are both dependent on TSMC for fabbing.  This gives them some flexibility in terms of not have a massive capital asset on their books, but at the same time, gives them other problems.  For starters TSMC is in Taiwan, which the Chinese have been claiming as theirs.  There was also the curious way NVidia was turning away customers when all the miners were buying everything they could get their hands on.  TSMC has recently announced they\'ll be building a fab in Arizona, but I still think Intel is going to have an advantage when it comes to concerns about national security.  Intel may also be capable of getting some help paying for their next fab from the US government for this reason.\n\nI do not think Intel will be going away any time soon, but I do think their stock isn\'t as sexy as AMD or NVida.  I think the biggest possible risk with owning Intel is that it\'s likely to move sideways for quite a while.

I recall California doing a study about single payer and even if all the existing employer premiums + Medicare &amp; Medicaid premiums could be redirected, you\'d still be short another $300B annually (and that\'s just one US state).

No company (in my opinion) is going to be able to produce enough vaccine to meet world-wide demand.  AstraZeneca (and maybe others) have already stated that they would produce a vaccine developed by another company to help meet demand if they are unable to come up with one that meets clinical standards. \n\nA number of people have pointed out that AstraZeneca has published a statement that they would not profit from any vaccine developed between them and Oxford University during the pandemic crisis. If you read between the lines of their statement, however, they did **NOT** say they wouldn't profit from a vaccine once the critical part of the crisis is past (which it appears to be in many parts of the world). \n\nI own a very small number of shares in AstraZeneca (which I have owned since before this all started). I did buy a couple of calls in AZN.  I do not own shares of Pfizer or Moderna or any of the other companies that are involved in searching for a COVID vaccine (that I'm aware of). I did also buy a few calls of Pfizer, and if I had to pick one, I would guess Pfizer will be the first to officially get a vaccine approved, but it's going to be close.

Stocks can trade with a rich valuation for a long time, but never have I seen a stock trade at such an aggressive valuation as TSLA without a correction at some point. I have no idea when that correction will come, but I'd be stunned if it doesn't.\n\nI'm not saying TSLA can't be a trillion dollar company at some point, but those betting on that at this moment in time are playing an extremely risky game. Investing is about balancing risk/reward. TSLA is so heavily weighted towards risk right now that even if you think it's theoretically possible they could reach a $1T valuation at some point you also have to accept theres a risk that at any point TSLA could be valued like a typical car company again and you lose most of your investment.\n\nBut to your point, if you invested in AMZN or MSFT during the height of the dotcom bubble it would have been extremely foolish. Most dot-com companies got wiped out completely, and of the few survivors (some of which you listed) took many years to recover their previous valuations. Others that survived are still yet to recover. The fact you think investing in AMZN at ATHs has always been a good bet and will continue to be a good bet will cost you a lot of money at some point."", 'Maybe because everyone is aware that israel is a bubble that is gonna explode at some point?

If this happens, then the fed will immediately have to walk away, and raise interest rates. This will cause the market bubble to completely explode. There is a real possibility of cost pull inflation to start rearing it’s head. \n\nImo, inflation won’t happen for a couple of years, but it will happen. The Fed is injecting so much liquidity into the markets. Cost push inflation is unlikely for awhile, because nobody is spending money at the moment.

But current market may be a bubble."", 'Like BBRW', 'China acted to cool the speculative frenzy in its $9.5 trillion stock market, ending a euphoric eight-day surge that had fueled worries of a new bubble in the making.\n\nSigns of Beijing’s unease over the rally’s speed emerged late Thursday, when a pair of government-owned funds announced plans to trim holdings of stocks that soared this week. On Friday the state-run China Economic Times warned about the dangers of a “crazy” bull market, while Caixin reported that regulators had asked mutual fund companies to cap the size of new products.\n\nTraders said the moves amounted to a warning from Chinese officialdom that the country’s world-beating equity boom has gone too far, too fast. While cheerleading from state-run media helped ignite gains at the end of last month, authorities appear keen to engineer a steady bull market rather than a repeat of the bubble that ended in a $5 trillion crash five years ago.\n\n“The signal could not be clearer -- stocks have just become too hot for the regulators’ liking,” said Niu Chunbao, a fund manager at Shanghai Wanji Asset Management Co. “A slight dip or so may put their minds more at ease at this point.”\n\nThe SSE 50 Index of Shanghai’s largest stocks ended the day 2.6% lower. The gauge had closed Thursday within 2 percentage points of its intraday peak in 2015.\n\nChinese officials have plenty of reasons to want a rising stock market. The wealth effect could help revive virus-crushed consumer demand, and higher share prices will make it easier for indebted companies to finance themselves. Investor optimism has also spilled into Hong Kong, helping to ease concern that China’s tightening political grip on the city will end its status as a financial hub.\n\nBut authorities also want to avoid a replay of 2015, when they were wrong-footed by both the scale of the stock market’s boom and severity of its bust. Beijing’s fumbled response to the crash eroded its reputation for competent economic management and saddled millions of individual investors with losses.\n\nChina’s National Council for Social Security Fund -- the country’s national pension fund -- said Thursday it intends to sell a stake of as much as 2% in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd. The fund, which oversees about 2.2 trillion yuan ($314 billion) in assets, said the sale was part of its “regular divesting activities.” The stock dropped 7.4% in Shanghai, the most in five months.\n\nThe National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co. -- a far smaller state-backed semiconductor fund aimed at fostering China’s homegrown chipmakers -- announced plans to offload shares in three firms. Textile maker Wuxi Taiji Industry Co., Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co., and Beijing BDStar Navigation Co. fell at least 3.8%.\n\nForeign-based funds turned net sellers of Chinese shares for the first time this month on Friday, dumping a net 4.4 billion yuan, the most since late March. They had pumped a net 63 billion yuan across the border via exchange links in July.\n\nChinese stocks had added about $1 trillion in value this week -- far outpacing gains in every other market worldwide amid signs of euphoria among the nation’s investing masses. Turnover has soared, margin debt is rising at the fastest pace since 2015 and online trading platforms have struggled to keep up with demand.\n\nWhile the reaction from Beijing has been swift this time, it pales in comparison to the heavy-handed trading restrictions imposed after the 2015 crash. As well as warnings from state media and caps on equity funds, China’s securities regulator took some concrete steps Wednesday to limit speculative behavior, publishing a list of 258 illegal margin financing platforms.\n\nManaging a slow bull run in China’s momentum-driven stock market has always been a challenge for Beijing. Whether current policies will achieve that goal remains to be seen. One retail investor said she made the most of Friday’s losses to load up on more shares.\n\n“It’s still just the middle of the rally,” said 30-year-old Jess Huang, who works at a state-owned enterprise in Beijing', 'Cause the tech market is in a bubble which causes the s&amp;p 500 to look like its recovered.\n\nOnce the tech bubble bursts then the s&amp;p 500 is gonna drop dragging all other sectors of the market with it.

I am currently focusing my efforts on learning to read and understand market/chart data. \n\nSince I have no prior experience investing in a market that isn\'t as volatile and crazy as today I pose the question: **Are trading options the way to go with the current market?**\n\nMy logic backing this argument is that there is no way to tell what tomorrow will bring. Although that is true any day of the year, it has only been amplified by the uncertainty and continuous policy changes happening around us daily. There is no telling at what point this dream will collapse and the bubble will burst. If the key is to beat the burst, are options not the best way to take advantage of the current market standing? If options allow you to maximize gains while limiting loss when used properly. Wouldn\'t the best ""game plan"" for the time being be to take advantage of short positions now, sell before the potential burst, and wait to make long term investments until the market stabilizes?\n\n*TLDR:* Does the current uncertainty of the market and constant volatility make options the best trading choice until the market re-stabilizes in a more realistic fashion?', ""VGT is a solid investment to get your money into tech with good diversity and low risk.

In the short term I dont think it is going down, but its current momentum will likely shift to be less agressively upward.\n\nThe biggest risk with Amazon is a broader market sell off driving all stocks down (I personally am against the idea of a complete tech bubble, so the sell off I am focused on here would be similar to March). Of course that is a risk with all stocks and trying to time the market is a fool’s game.\n\nAnyways here is a little data to back things up:\n\nAmazon’s EPS jumped 3x in 2018 up to $20.14. For a long time (before 2016) Amazon was operating on very thin earnings as it was using the tactic of underpricing its competition and operating at a loss until it had the monopoly it has now when it can (and likely will) slowly drive up prices (hence the jump is earnings in 2018).\n\nAmazon’s PE ratio is VERY high at 152.06, but this is lower than its all time high of 3633 in 2012. Now the past isnt necessarily an indication of the future, but Amazon’s stock has has jumped more than tenfold since that time. Now comparing it to its ATH is not necessarily the best comparison, but if we look at 2015-2020 Q1  there have only been 9 quarters with a PE under its current point. Including several quarter to quarter jumps of 80+ (larger than Q1-Q2 of around 60). The Q1-Q2 rise in stock price was massive, but the underlying financials seem to be solid.\n\ntl;dr: Amazon will probably continue to rise in the short term at a slower rate than the last two months, but will likely see massive gains coming into Q1 and Q2 2021.', ""&gt; You realize without Capitalism you would have no progress or innovation?\n\n\nI do, and without the government controlling the corporations, you get USA.

Whether or not a stock is ""cheap"" or ""expensive"" is a weighted function of the fundamentals that match their financial characteristics. \n\nFor example, value stocks are traditionally cashflow investments, so metrics like P/E ratios provide a good basis for comparing them to other cashflowing investments. If you look at a stock solely in terms of P/E ratios, it implies that revenue growth is approximately 0% which allows that fundamental to be ignored. Many of your classic ""blue chip"" stocks look like this.\n\nGrowth stocks invest part or all of their profit into revenue rather than earnings. Since the output of these companies is revenue, they don\'t cashflow, the directly relevant metrics are things like market cap/revenue ratios. If you look at these fundamentals, you\'ll see that while TSLA is expensive, it is no more expensive than MSFT! And other growth stocks that are at all time highs right now, such as AMZN, are still surprisingly cheap. Not cheap in absolute terms such that you\'d mortgage your house to buy the stock, but not crazy bubble expensive either. \n\nThere is a smaller group of stocks that cannot be usefully analyzed as pure examples of either earnings-driven (""value"") or revenue-driven (""growth"") stocks because they have strong elements of both. AAPL is a canonical example of this.\n\nAll of the above ignores that these metrics need to be risk-adjusted, which is not trivial to get at. For example, while TSLA and MSFT have similar metrics as growth stocks, most risk models are going to assert that the risk to those metrics is much lower for MSFT, so MSFT is actually cheaper than TSLA. \n\nTSLA is expensive any way you look at it but its expensiveness relative to boring cheap growth stocks like AMZN is overstated.

I have a few questions:\n\n1. **Is  there any benefit to selling all of it at once, vs. \\~$3,000 each year?**  This is the limit you can claim (deduct from your income) on taxes each  year, and I don\'t see the benefit of selling more than this amount,  other than the fact that **this stock could be de-listed in the future, which would make it even harder to sell**...I  definitely don\'t want to miss out on any tax advantages if this were to  happen. Selling $3,000 worth each year also allows me to hold onto  shares in the extremely unlikely event that the stock rebounds (I am not  counting on this happening whatsoever).\n\nI\'m aware that the loss can be carried forward for \'tax-free gains\'  on other capital gains (which I don\'t plan on having anytime soon)? I\'m  not a real estate investor/flipper, in case you\'re wondering, and am not selling property (I don\'t own any).

And this by its very nature encourages people to invest with a very long term view - IE, I can afford low rates now so long as I own a stock that 10 years from now, can dominate the industry and churn out revenue. In other words, there has been a large push for duration due to low and falling rates, in which technology is more or less the largest proxy for duration.\n\nOn top of that, technology ***is*** growing relative to other market sectors, and hasn\'t been hurt nearly as hard as other industries due to Covid 19. I agree that tech is a bit bubbly, but if you look under the hood at what is driving the enormous outperformance, it\'s really not all that surprising. And this is also ignoring how much the passive and momentum parts of the market exacerbate trends like this.\n\n**Understanding the Energy ""Bust""**\n\nEnergy for a long time has used cheap financing to massively over-expand. The fracking industry for one has only produced negative value for investors, yet all the expansion in capacity has driven down energy prices. Low rates tend to encourage excessive capacity, which then drives down the cost of commodities. Remember that point the next time anybody tries to argue that low rates cause inflation...\n\nWith all that said, we have finally started to see a decent bit of bankruptcies in the fracking sector, and a lot of oil producers have been put in a very precarious financial position. If you\'re Russia or Saudi Arabia, you can weather a low oil price storm for some time, and will even benefit from it if this can destroy the excess supply glut in the long run by forcing other oil producers out of business. It\'s essentially a gigantic price war on a national scale that may force a lot of production offline. So long term, I think there is one more good oil bull market left in the world, but I would assume we will continue to see tons of volatility in energy markets along the way.\n\nRealistically, the thing that will cause oil price to rise again is a sustained reduction in oil production capacity. Overall, I don\'t think options are a great way to play this - you\'re probably better off just owning domestic oil majors with strong balance sheets where you can collect a decent dividend while being patient in waiting for a recovery.\n\nOne other point that you touch on is that there is likely no better asset to own than domestic energy companies with regard to protection against any significant geopolitical conflict.', ""Trying to inflate the bubble even more so you can get out?\n\nIf you didn't get into tech riding this up, now's not the time to open yoour position."", ""Yes, but only once this bubble pops.

During Provident’s tenure as portfolio manager to September 30, 2018, PROVX gained +389% cumulatively with a 79.8% average month-end allocation to equities vs. +348% for the always fully invested S&amp;P 500."")\n\nSo that\'s an example of a fund where managers will start to move to the sideline if they think it\'s prudent to do so. Not entirely - you\'re still going to lose some money - just probably not as much as the market in a downturn. \n\nIf it\'s a bad year most funds are going to have a bad year and the letter will be basically, ""Hey, sorry it was a bad year.""\n\nStock index funds are going to go down in a downturn whatever the index does.\n\n""I remember seeing a video interview of this analyst on Robinhood who said that the tech bubble right now is bigger than the dot com bubble was in the 2000s.""\n\nI don\'t think this is the dot com bubble again. I do think that after the bottom in March, you saw a widening of the gap between the performance of the market and the performance of certain growth themes that were either less impacted by this or benefited from it. E-commerce, digital payments, cloud, software, telehealth and the ""stay at home"" names (Peloton, Netflix, etc.) Even the ""buy a home online"" names, as things like Zillow finally started to seem to have a sustained gain for once as people are now apparently comfortable buying houses virtually. People basically ran towards what they thought benefited today and I think what many people thought the future is going to look like post-crisis. I think what\'s been very frustrating on this sub this year has been this focus on the negative, when I think a compelling topic really is, what are the themes post-crisis that will be big? How does the world change in the next 3-5 years? **I think what\'s done extraordinarily well this year is in part due to the result of people asking themselves that question and investing accordingly.** The ARKW and ARKF have themes listed on the main pages for those funds and you look at those themes and those have absolutely been the places to be this year.\n\nIn the short-term, I have a hard time believing that the correct answer to concerning statistics will continue to be ""just buy more growth (Zoom, etc) stocks."" At some point that will either stop working and broad market pullback or there will be a solution to this crisis and when that happens you\'re going to see a considerable rotation out of the Ark-style growth stocks and into impacted names that have lagged, but I think that is going to be buying opportunity for growth. \n\nYou\'ve saw this sort of ""tale of two markets"" again on Thursday and Friday of last week: Thursday the Dow was down 300 but growth stocks were ramping. There was the Gilead news on Friday and the Dow was up 300 but many of the growth stocks were down.\n\nMuch of my own portfolio is similarly aggressive growth to Ark or Scottish Mortgage and I would not be surprised if at some point in the near-term much of my portfolio lost 20% in a hurry. The problem is when: I thought there was going to be a pullback in May - didn\'t happen. I have a long-term view on what I own so I may trim a little here, add a little there at times but happy not doing much of anything for long stretches. Additionally, I\'m not a major market timer or do I have any desire to be. But after a really fantastic first half of the year, I really don\'t think that I\'m going to have a repeat of that kind of performance in the back half of the year and I\'m sitting here fully expecting a considerable pullback. If I manage to get through the second half of the year without a considerable pullback in my portfolio, I will be 1) stunned and 2) have to question whether this time is actually somehow different. I\'ve said recently that I did a lot in March and April and then have since gone back to doing not much and am happy with long stretches of doing little-to-nothing. I\'m okay with investing in aggressive growth stocks, but where I\'m increasingly cautious is where/how much I add to things. \n\nBut, long story short, I think there are compelling long-term growth themes and growth may continue up for a while, but it is overextended and a considerable correction at some point in the relatively near-term would be so not surprising that it would be pretty remarkable imo if it didn\'t happen. Broadly, if you\'re not risk tolerant (and there\'s nothing wrong with that), then the ARK funds would not be something I\'d recommend (great when things are fantastic for growth, going to be rough when it\'s not - they\'ve had an amazing year, but people have to be cognizant of things capable of having those kinds of gains in that short a time period are also capable of going the wrong direction just as swiftly, if not swifter) or at the most would be a *tiny* bit to have exposure to some themes long-term - but I\'d be particularly cautious about where you bought them.', ""We haven't seen any inflation yet, and the market needs a massive inflation to justify it's valuations.  It's clearly a massive bubble, but my bet is the valuations correct way before the fundamentals do in a positive direction, since earnings are actually getting worse."", ""Let me start from the top here:\n\nFirst, what you describe as 'hopium' is not the case. That would be the case if I was 'hoping' for the closure of some of the biggest uranium mines, that I was 'hoping' for public support by the government of the largest uranium consuming country in the world and that I was 'hoping' that we will need nuclear power to battle climate change like the majority of researchers believe as well and is described here https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2019/07/11/why-the-world-needs-nuclear-power/amp/ \nThis article is just to give an example, there are plenty of other sources out there describing the same thing.\n\n\nNow, as for the thinner margins and import. Around 40% of the world's uranium is already provided for by Kazakhstan, which is the lowest cost produced uranium in the world. Can they produce more? Not likely, because they have publicly announced to start producing less in the light of low uranium prices, so that argument doesn't fly. As for the subsidizing of uranium miner, that is exactly what is proposed by the US government with their 1.5 billion dollar plan over the next 10 years for US uranium miners.\n\n\nHow many new reactors? Well over a 100, with close to 400 being proposed around the world right now. What type? Mostly generation 3 and 4, but there are plans to focus more on SMR's in the future so that less energy heavy regions can benefit from nuclear power without needing a huge reactor. These do need less enriched fuel, but they still need the damn fuel and with a supply deficit like we see now, that fuel is scarce when it needs to be imported from thede miners. As for thorium? Yeah that would be better, if it wasn't for the fact that no commercial grade thorium reactors are viable yet and non are planned to being built on a big scale before the end of this decade.\n\n\nThe contracts? If you read my post you would see that I mentioned those, the fact that these long term (10 year) contracts are signed and that causes prices to fall because utilities are now saturated. You know when the last contracting cycle was? Roughly 10 years ago, information that can easily be found and which shows that utilities need to renegotiate new contracts soon.\n\n\nThe dude trust me part was a light hearted meme, I thought it would help a bit with a post that is filled with information some might consider boring. Also for the 'bubble' you describe, it was a combination of the flooding of two major mines and the shifting sentiment towards nuclear power. While yes, it was overblown and that could be considered a bubble, it was very much still a logical market response that only lost steam because of the economic collapse and later Fukushima.\n\n\nAs you can see there are plenty of reason to believe as spike in uranium prices is coming as soon as this year. You are asking all the right questions and it is good that you are skeptical, but every comment you made can be deflated when you look at the facts.\n\n\nI hope this helps and if you have any more questions, I'd be happy to provide an answer to them. I am not here to pump a stock or lose 'amateurs' money, I am here to help and present a different type of investment, I hope you understand that."", 'All bubbles are different.

I consider myself an investor, in it for the long-term. So even if a major down-turn were to happen, it would sting, but it will eventually recover. I believe all of the major stakes I posses AAPL, MSFT, TSLA are more than strong enough to weather anything thrown at them and come through stronger then before. This also goes to your point that I invested a fuck ton of money, I\'d say I really haven\'t, excluding TSLA. I generally made one time investments of about $10k each, reinvest dividends and occasionally buy a few additional shares if I can\'t find anything else to invest into at the time and just let it sit. I don\'t actively trade anything. I\'ve also been in the bigger positions for 6ish years, well before this major upturn we\'re in the midst of, which I think has been rightfully earned. \n\nI\'m sure a tech-sector pullback will happen, but not to the level of a ""burst bubble."" AAPL and MSFT have been slowly building and diversifying their companies over the last two decades to get to where they are now, built on very solid ground. It wasn\'t some overnight event that got them to their current valuations. With MSFT, they have the potential for exponential growth as more and more companies utilize their high margin cloud services. And with all of the hype AAPL gets, MSFT has been a better performer over the years.\n\nI\'m not seeing the same potential for AAPL as they have been rather stagnant since Jobs died. They are moving more and more into the services area, but they have a lot of competition there and their offerings are nothing special. I see them acquiring companies to better compete in the future, such as SPOT or DIS, that would give them a services portfolio worth something, instead of the current ground up approach. As far as we know they don\'t have anything revolutionary in the pipeline to ""breakout.""\n\nTSLA has two big days coming up that I think are points of no return if they go as many people expect. The Q2 earnings on 7/22 and Battery day on 9/22. If they turn a profit, they will be put into the S&amp;P, potentially increasing who is buying the shares, thus raising share price since it would have limited supply. And if Battery Day is as mind blowing as the claims are, it has the potential to exponentially improve their position in the market, increase production, which they are limited by now, and potentially lead to licensing the tech to further their mission. \n\nI am and have been worried about FB, which I have been itching to get out of for a while.

At least with tech, it\'s mostly iterative, so you know that if it has a solid foundation, it has a higher potential of success.

Most of them actually ARE terrible to hold but there are exceptions. \n\nAlso I wouldn't buy TQQQ right now regardless because I feel like we're in a bubble market.

But that said, tech is clearly where most topline growth is going to be for the foreseeable future, wrapped in all the stories of disruption/changing the world. if you don't find that to be a controversial statement, you should probably have some exposure to tech in a portfolio (this doesn't mean a portfolio of just tech stocks). \n\nMomentum chasing tends to work in tech more often that not (people love the shiny thing), but the meltdowns can be pretty nasty (all this technical analysis stuff is really just momentum chasing with flashy names in my mind). Statistically, things like momentum chasing work, but the meltdowns are painful. If you are really trying to invest with a medium/long-time horizon, focus on fundamentals, but expand the way you think about valuation (not fundamentals - if TSLA doesn't produce cash, and you have doubts that it will, then there's likely not a valuation that will make you comfortable) - you hvae to use a different value tool kit for some areas of tech. Bc of the way accounting works for a lot of software and names like NFLX, things like P/E and P/B just aren't useful.\n\nYou don't have to play in the names where you think the valuation are crazy; there are plenty of tech stocks that hv reasonable fundamentals and valuations that will provide great returns (just not TSLA like returns, but that's both good and bad).  The stories / fundamentals are amazing for some of these, but doesn't mean that they are good stocks over the long run. The 2014 tech selloff is a good example when names like SPLK, WDAY and FEYE were trading at &gt;20x forward revs. If you owned those stocks at the beginning of March 2014 with the belief that these companies' fundamentals are amazing - you didn't make your money back until 2018 despite both companies doing what they were supposed to do  (40% CAGR over 6 yrs, turned profitable and produced FCF - i being liberal with SPLK here). FEYE is an example of where it turned out that all that exuberance was just wrong  (stock went from $36 to touching in 5 months, and is now at $13)""]"

That normally means investors (back of the queue) will get nothing and the exchange stops trading the stock. It crashes down to zero or near enough before that once bag holders realise what a sack of shit they are holding.\n\nI think most of the companies under discussion announced they were planning to seek bankruptcy protection and then experienced a rally based on the notion that there would be a residual value after bankruptcy. This caused a quick bubble in which the stock price went up many times and then fell. This could allow a reissue to raise more funds but in any case there should be a residual value as the company isn't bankrupt.

Fed\'s corp bond program has been lackluster ( [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/07/13/the-feds-corporate-bond-buying-has-been-relatively-small-and-positively-useless/#6a3563977c75](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/07/13/the-feds-corporate-bond-buying-has-been-relatively-small-and-positively-useless/#6a3563977c75) )   and rumor has it they\'re in talks to lower contributions leading up to a short and long term marker. Short term is the August passage / reformation of a 2nd stimulus bill, Long term is the November elections. \n2. Social unrest, hodgepodge reopenings and a patchwork of ""fixes"" have lead to a ""Wave 1.5"". In addition to being bad for business, Fed restrictions on banks ( [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/fed-puts-restrictions-on-bank-dividends-after-test-finds-some-banks-could-be-stressed-in-pandemic.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/fed-puts-restrictions-on-bank-dividends-after-test-finds-some-banks-could-be-stressed-in-pandemic.html) )  means, in simple terms, this one is gonna hit much harder. Both for investors and for the small businesses that rely on these banks. \n3. Given August is the earliest the 2nd Stim bill can be heard, and July 31st is when unemployment benefits run out, in addition to state coffers ranging from low to barren, theres some definite uncertainty regarding what workforce if any will remain once this entire situation is over.   \nIn March we were in uncharted territory but there was at least some faith that States and the Fed had the money to prop us up until a vaccine came out. The only thing worse than unplanned uncertainty, is planned uncertainty. \n4.  A large portion of the last Stimulus bill went to personal savings ( [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimwang/2020/06/25/how-are-americans-spending-stimulus-checks/#280d46ace311](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimwang/2020/06/25/how-are-americans-spending-stimulus-checks/#280d46ace311) )  While 12% might not seem alot, remember that prior to the pandemic only \\~4-7% of Americans had more than $1500 saved.   \nSetting aside the fact this will likely hinder future checks; this speaks to a larger problem of continuing and growing deflation. What little consumer spending is being divvied up between top 100 corps and the markets. This could be the beginning of a deathspiral for all except the 1% of the 1% \\*even if a vaccine is discovered tomorrow\\*   \nSomething else to consider is that even in the best case scenario, we\'ll be dealing with a rubberband inflation effect of the Fed printing so much even if we find a way to counter this mass deflation. \n5. Looming TikTok ban, Facebook boycott, Twitter just... in general. Social media is looking to be as unstable as it ever has been. Possible crater if we see government crackdowns. \n6. China is going to be a large destabilizing factor in a second downturn too. It\'s just recently come to light that Chinese companies are diluting the Precious Metals market ( [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/06/30/world/asia/30reuters-china-gold-kingold-jewelry.html](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/06/30/world/asia/30reuters-china-gold-kingold-jewelry.html)  ) likely with much more going unreported.

However, if they know something bad is coming a little further down the line, increased buying activity could only reflect them shorting their own company - which is of course illegal, but does happen. A more legitimate example could be insiders within an IPO banking on major early gains based on hype with the expectation that things will cool off once the hype dies down. \n\nAgain, guarding yourself against this still requires your own due diligence and attention to fundamentals.

They\'ve all been hobbled to one degree or another due to COVID-related production delays, but those won\'t last forever. Plus, Disney+, HBOMax, Peacock all are missing IP because of pre-existing contracts with Netflix. All have said, to one degree or another, that they will not be renewing those contracts. As that IP ""returns home"" and their original programming gets in full swing competing services are going to be more attractive to customers while Netflix becomes comparatively less so.\n\n2) Netflix has been taking on massive amounts of debt trying to develop original programming to make up for that anticipated loss of content. Its competitors are content creators first, and streamers second. Even if they somehow able to service all that debt, they simply can\'t compete with the combined content creation capabilities of Time Warner, Disney, Universal, etc. And if they aren\'t growing subscribers as quickly as expected (they\'re not), then their ability to service that debt load in the future can quickly start becoming an issue.\n\n3) Speaking of that original programming, quite frankly most of it isn\'t very good at all (just try to watch some of those Adam Sandler movies that they threw $275 million at him to make). People like to focus, understandably, on the good ones. But a lot of that debt they\'re taking on is essentially being thrown down the drain.\n\n4) Netflix\'s primary advantage has been having an essential monopoly on the streaming business. Hulu and Prime Video have been around, but it\'s a side business for Amazon and Hulu has primarily been in the rebroadcast business rather than creating originals. With the expiring relationship with Comcast and Disney\'s acquisition of Fox, Hulu is going to be getting a lot of new programming in the future. Netflix has had its choice of properties to acquire for their service in the past, but there is going to be a lot more competition for the best ones going forward which means a lower net quality of Netflix original programming and much higher costs.\n\n5) There are even more streaming services coming. Discovery Networks has already announced that they will be putting up their own and CBS/Viacom is working on one as well. And I haven\'t even mentioned Apple TV+. \n\n6) All of that adds up to subscription-hopping - something Netflix has never really had to deal with before. People may still subscribe to Netflix, but necessarily for 12 months out of the year. Maybe they\'ll pause their accounts for a month to catch up on HBOMax, maybe a month on Disney+, maybe a month on Peacock, etc. Even if their subscribers start pausing a single month out of the year, Netflix\'s revenue will take a serious dip.\n\nNetflix isn\'t going anywhere (unless their debt service winds up crippling them), but their days as the undisputed King of the Hill of OTTs is likely coming to an end within the next few years.', 'Consider it a hobby that costs you $80 per week to participate in.', '🤷\u200d♂️.

There was no internet, you had to mail your stock purchases to your broker and be charged a hefty trading fee, and the vast majority of people owned no stock at all. His books still have some merit, but once something becomes maxim it no longer becomes a realistic way to achieve real gains.\n\nFor 20 years now, stock price has been heavily weighted toward revenue (or perhaps free cash flow) because of the huge shift toward reinvesting profits to avoid taxes and fuel growth/expansion such that companies don’t prioritize earnings. The concept of a subscription software service wouldn’t make sense to Graham.\n\nRead Graham, Buffet (letters to stockholders), Lynch, etc. but also read some newer books like Moore’s Gorilla Game (which itself became obsolete). \n\nAs for the dot com meltdown, the biggest issue then was that companies were being valued based on potential visitors to a web site. Not actual visitors, let alone actual converting visitors to sales. This drove up prices of random web sites with no sales, which in turn meant the companies that were actually viable were worth even more (if Pets.com is worth $400 million with less than $1 million in revenue, just imagine what Amazon is worth). So those got driven up as well, everyone and their grandmother caught the serious case of FOMO, and things got bid up ridiculously.\n\nToday we might have a little bit of excess steam in the market from people trying to trade stocks (or worse, options) because they lost their jobs or otherwise have nothing better to do, but at least things are valued mostly on forward looking revenue or earnings estimates depending on the type of company and it’s stage in the company’s life cycle. One can argue that things are getting too forward looking — maybe looking 3 years ahead into the unknown future — but most companies (Nikola excluded) actually have sales. You can toss on a “story” or fanboy premium on some companies as well (Tesla, Beyond Meat), occasional sector related bubbles (blockchain for a while, marijuana more recently), or a supercharged case of biotech gambling with Covid related companies.\n\nTLDR: Yes, stock prices are loosely tied to revenue, but the value of revenue varies greatly depending on the perceived outlook for the company (especially future growth, profitability, and durability).', 'And when they subs see it’s free and see all the new adds you will see a mass dismissal of this.

When rates are low it\'s cheap to borrow money so people buy homes, companies borrow cash to reinvest in their businesses, and the economy grows. \n\nThe Fed also prints money but the thing a lot of people don\'t understand is that the amount of money printed isn\'t pre-determined by the Fed. When you go get a mortgage at the bank, they aren\'t necessarily lending you money from other people\'s deposits or money that the bank has, they\'re creating the money to lend you through manipulating their balance sheet. This means that money shows up in an account out of thin air. If that money goes into circulation it can cause inflation. When rates are low, more money gets created.\n\nIn general the Fed wants to cut rates when the economy is in trouble because low rates stimulate economic activity. Raising rates has the opposite effect, it lowers economic activity, reins in inflation, and causes businesses and individuals to lower expenses in general which can lead to rises in unemployment and lower production capability.\n\nDuring the past decade of bull markets rates never went up. So now that shit hit the fan the fed has to simulate cutting rates by pumping cash into the economy, which is called ""quantitative easing"" or more commonly abbreviated to QE. This is why the market can do well despite most of the economy ""shutting off"" during the pandemic. The problem is that if we start to see inflation go out of control, the fed will have to stop QE and potentially raise rates even if they know it will cause major economic problems for years to come.

Now we end up with drivers in areas forming coalitions to keep prices high and quality low, and we’re back to the start of all of this, just with extra steps. Turning Uber into a taxi-focused TaskRabbit would be their downfall because it would be incredibly easy for existing players to eat their lunch.\n\nUber tried to take only the benefits of contractors and only the benefits of salaried employees and sell that. They ignored all the costs associated with both and offloaded even more costs to math-challenged drivers. That’s how they undercut the industry to the degree they did. We all assumed they had an endgame to transition from law-skirting startup to legitimate enterprise, but we now see they do not.', ""I was on the verge of buying a home, but I have decided to wait. Note that everything depends on the specific area you want to buy in, but most of the conversation you will read on Reddit relates to USA-centric national trends. People are sloshing out of cities right now into places with more outdoor, private space, but that could be a short(ish)-term, trend. Real estate is local.\n\n1) We have had very low interest rates for a decade, and housing prices have been rising faster than normal, for years. Prices had plateaued before the virus hit, and the thinking was that we had already hit a price peak and were due for a correction. The current panic-buying is seemingly worsening a bubble in house prices, since prices have spiked due to reduced inventory (people don't want dozens of strangers coming into their home during an open house, etc.). So it makes sense to wait out the current spike in prices.\n\n2) The Federal Reserve has stated that they plan on keeping rates low for a very long time. This is always subject to change, but based off of this there is no rush to take advantage of low rates.\n\n3) The USA does not do a good job of supporting its citizens during economic crises, compared to peer nations. The next round of citizen-stimulus is expected to be even less than the previous round (which was paltry). There is a backlog of layoffs and evictions and mortgage defaults. The economic impact of this has been delayed, but it is expected to begin making an impact in coming months. \n\nThere is more to add to this. But broadly speaking, homes are historically overpriced and there are strong reasons to expect a retracement in prices. This is a seller's environment, not a good time to be a buyer. \n\nIf home prices sag, I don't think they will dip much below pre-pandemic pricing. The wealthiest people in the world have so much money that they have invested in all of the things worth investing in (and then some), and are struggling to find investments that will produce a worthwhile return. They have no reason to wait for a 10%  discount on an asset if a 2.5% price-reduction moves the asset into investable territory. The economic model that the world has subscribed to is an absolute, utter failure of humanity at every level.

Most of them in the last 100 years have been, but some of them have not, like 1987 was not intentionally created.  For whatever reason, when the Fed chose to pop the 2000 stock market bubble, they waited quite a while, which is why it was the worst stock market fall since 1929, worse than today.  2008 was artificially created through laws that changed the way banks can create loans and intentionally popped.\n\nYou can tell ahead of time when a crash will happen, because the Fed will adjust the interest rate 6+ months before the stock market fall.  Pops happen in slow motion.  When the Fed does it this way, it creates a mini boom as a side effect before the fall, which is why the last year before a crash is the most lucrative.', 'Corporate vitriol aside — the answer is in the question.

Buy Rehab rent refinance assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans). Things can go wrong and you don't have a way to pay the hard money back. This is not for inexperienced investors unless you have your own money or another way to pay the loan if things don't go right .\n\nOthers recommend not putting more than 5% down when purchasing a property. Being heavily in debt is not a good idea when there is a crisis and you still have bills to pay but no income .

Yeah, companies can grow (Amazon for instance) but unless Tesla plans on owning a country (ala East India Trading Company) there’s only so much a company can grow, and last I checked Pepsi was the last company to have a military large enough to pull off what Tesla would have to do to justify their stock price (Google “Pepsi Navy” if you’re curious).\n\nI don’t think anything that happens to Tesla short of a bursting bubble is reasonable.', 'Can someone eli5 this for me?

Buy Rehab rent refinance assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans).

Expense ratio (basically how much it costs to own the fund over time), depending on your time horizon the Lower this is the better \n2. Asset class based risk: there are many different types of ETFs/Funds which track different asset classes. Depending on your expected returns and risk tolerance you should look at wether or not you want to split your money up into bond funds (low risk, low return), index funds (medium risk, medium return), or specific sector or sets of securities (righer risk, higher return) \n\n3. Sector vs. whole market performance: the benchmark index returns are measured against is the S&amp;P 500, a group of large-cap (think big) companies which are considered “blue-chip” stocks.

Similarly there are other indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Avwrage (industrials) or the Nasdaq (tech). You can invest in ETFs that track these broad indexes, or invest in ones that track a specific sector. Think of this like an ETF that only holds E-Commerce stocks, or only oil stocks, or only cloud-based internet stocks.

For non-ionising radiation we have to limit exposure because body tissue heats up when it absorbs them.  \n  \nConsider sunlight, which is a broad band of EM. We can feel infrared heating us up but we can't feel the UV burning us.  \n  \nWell, [5G is going to use frequencies up to about 100GHz](https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30805-50906-An-illustration-of-the-areas-of-spectrum-5G-could-operate-within-via-Qualcomm-xl.jpg) which is much lower frequency band than sunlight and is not ionising radiation.  \n  \n5G is actually using microwaves so you know it can cook your flesh, except the power output of your phone's radio is kept well under the safe limits. The phone towers are a higher power output but the inverse square law means the receive level is quite low by the time it gets to you, and because of the number of mobile users, 5G towers and 4G towers are very close together transmitting on low power because that gives a cleaner signal and more data throughput.  \n  \nFinally I will quote the safe limit of 100GHz microwave output. [This NIH page mentions 10 Watts per square meter and 0.08 Watts per Kg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/) A 5G phone will never get anywhere near that and the tower signal will be received by the antenna at about 0.0000001 Watts  and I would guess that your body would absorb about 1 milliWatt max from the tower. \n  \nSo because we have blood and sweat cooling us down, the tiny bit of heat is no issue. We're talking milliwatts total, compared to   sunlight which is about 1000W of radiation per square meter and some of that is ionising, unlike 5G. And even sunlight isn't too bad in moderation but 5G is fine as a low level background signal. Actually if you look on a spectrum analyser... there is a noise floor at 100GHz with signals here and there anyway.  \n  \nI hope that puts it into perspective... 5G is basically low power warm radiation and doesn't modify DNA (doesn't cause cancer). And it can't cook you because the power output is low, like TV and FM signals. It is like TV and radio signals but a higher band and with a much more efficient modulation scheme for data throughput.  \n  \nThanks for listening to my TED Talk."", '# Today is Wednesday, the 22nd of July\n\n\n\n## Upcoming events for Wednesday, July 22nd\n\n - Stock splits:\n\n    - CTMCF @ **1:10**\n    - RYPPF @ **1:10**\n    - PAUFF @ **1:3**\n\n - Expected earnings:\n\n  ABB, AFI, ALGN, APH, ARR, ATEC, ATNI, AVNT, AXTI, BANR, BCOV, BDN, BEDU, BFST, BIIB, BKR, BOKF, BRKL, CADE, CAJ, CASH, CBD, CBNK, CHKP, CHX, CKH, CLB, CLBK, CLGX, CMG, CMRE, CNS, CP, CPAC, CPSS, CSX, CTO, CUBI, CVBF, CVCY, CVLG, DB, DFS, DOV, ECHO, EFX, EGBN, EIG, EVR, FARO, FBNC, FCCO, FCFS, FR, FSB, GGG, GL, GSK, GTY, HCA, HCCI, HLX, ICLR, INBK, INVA, IQV, JMP, KALU, KEY, KMI, KNX, LAD, LMST, LN, LOB, LSTR, LVS, MCB, MCRI, MHO, MKTX, MLCO, MSA, MSC, MSFT, MTH, NDAQ, NFBK, NRZ, NTB, NTGR, NTRS, NVR, OBNK, ODT, OMAB, OMC, ORRF, OSBC, PINE, PLXS, RCI, RCKY, RLI, RUSHA, SAVE, SBSI, SCCO, SCL, SEIC, SJW, SLG, SLGN, SLM, SLRX, SONM, STC, STL, SU, SUI, SYBT, TCBI, TCFC, TDY, TLRD, TMO, TRN, TRVG, TSC, TSLA, UFPI, UMPQ, USAP, UVSP, VAR, VMI, WHR, WIX, WPG, WSBC, WSBF\n\n - Ex-div:\n\n  AGX, BGH, COO, CVS, DX, FMN, FSLF, LTC\n\n - Economic events and announcements:\n\n    - 20-Year Bond Auction (previous: 1.314%)\n    - Crude Oil Imports (previous: -1.983M)\n    - Crude Oil Inventories (consensus: -2.088M, previous: -7.493M)\n    - Cushing Crude Oil Inventories (previous: 0.949M)\n    - Distillate Fuel Production (previous: 0.104M)\n    - EIA Refinery Crude Runs  (previous: -0.038M)\n    - EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks (consensus: -0.618M, previous: -0.453M)\n    - EIA Weekly Refinery Utilization Rates (previous: 0.6%)\n    - Existing Home Sales (consensus: 24.5%, previous: -9.7%)\n    - Existing Home Sales (consensus: 4.78M, previous: 3.91M)\n    - Gasoline Inventories (consensus: -1.386M, previous: -3.147M)\n    - Gasoline Production (previous: 0.050M)\n    - Heating Oil Stockpiles (previous: 0.420M)\n    - House Price Index (previous: 0.2%)\n    - House Price Index (previous: 288.3)\n    - House Price Index (previous: 5.5%)\n    - MBA 30-Year Mortgage Rate (previous: 3.19%)\n    - MBA Mortgage Applications (previous: 5.1%)\n    - MBA Purchase Index (previous: 305.4)\n    - Mortgage Market Index (previous: 815.5)\n    - Mortgage Refinance Index (previous: 3,774.3)\n    - Seevol Cushing Storage Report (previous: 1.748M)\n\n## Upcoming events for Thursday, July 23rd\n\n - Stock splits:\n\n    - BBX @ **1:5**\n    - PREF @ **5:1** (Payable date: )\n\n - Expected earnings:\n\n  AAL, AB, ABEV, ACBI, ADS, AEP, ALK, ALKS, ALLE, AN, APD, ARD, ASB, ASPS, AUB, AUY, BANC, BJRI, BOOM, BPOP, BPRN, BWB, BX, BY, CFB, CLFD, CMS, COLB, CSTR, CTAS, CTS, CTXS, CVE, CX, CYBE, DECK, DEO, DGX, DHR, DOW, DRQ, EHTH, ENTG, EQNR, ERIE, ESQ, ETFC, EW, EWBC, FAF, FBIZ, FCX, FE, FET, FFBC, FFNW, FITB, FIX, FMBH, FOR, FRME, FSBW, FSV, FWRD, GBCI, GCAP, GHL, GLOP, GLPG, GNCA, GPL, GTLS, GWW, HBAN, HBIO, HEES, HFWA, HONE, HRI, HSY, HTBI, HTBK, HZO, ICBK, IEX, INDB, INT, INTC, ISTR, JILL, KMB, KOF, LMAT, LNTH, LOGM, LUV, LYV, MANH, MAT, MCBC, MITK, MNOV, MOFG, MPB, MSBI, MTA, MTB, MTRN, MXL, MYFW, NOK, NUE, NURO, OCFC, OMCL, OPBK, ORI, OZK, PAC, PBCT, PCB, PDS, PHM, PNR, POOL, POWI, PTEN, RBNC, RCL, RGP, RHI, RNGR, RS, SAFE, SAM, SASR, SBBX, SBCF, SCHL, SCPL, SGMS, SHBI, SIVB, SKX, SMMF, SMP, SMSI, SONA, STM, SWKS, T, TACO, TBNK, TCBK, TCO, TECK, TEF, TILE, TMUS, TOT, TOWN, TREE, TRV, TSCO, TTM, TWTR, UBSI, UHS, UNP, VICR, VLRS, VLY, VRSN, VVI, WBS, WRLD, WSFS, WSO, WST, WTBA, WTER\n\n - Ex-div:\n\n  BGB, BGX, BSL, BUSE, BWG, COKE, DFP, DMO, EFF, EFR, EFT, EHI, EMD, EOI, EOS, EOT, ETB, ETG, ETJ, ETO, ETV, ETW, ETX, ETY, EVG, EVT, EXD, EXG, FFC, FLC, GAIN, GDO, GFY, GLAD, GOOD, HFRO, HGLB, HIE, HIO, HIX, HYI, IGI, J, KALU, LAND, LKFN, MGU, MMU, MTT, MVC, NHF, NTG, NVT, PBA, PBR, PBR.A, PFD, PG, PNR, PPT, SBI, TPZ, TYG, USA, WEA, WIA, WIW, WSM\n\n - Economic events and announcements:\n\n    - 10-Year TIPS Auction (previous: -0.470%)\n    - 4-Week Bill Auction (previous: 0.105%)\n    - 8-Week Bill Auction (previous: 0.110%)\n    - Continuing Jobless Claims (consensus: 17,067K, previous: 17,338K)\n    - Initial Jobless Claims (consensus: 1,300K, previous: 1,300K)\n    - Jobless Claims 4-Week Avg.

It can pay for your kid's education or for whatever fancies you and is still there for your retirement. Unlike stocks .\nKeep in mind that 33% of Americans rent their home .\n\nThere are 2 ways to invest : 1) buy and hold which produces income or 2) flipping which if done right can grow your investment quickly .\n\nLocation, location location!  Meaning buy near Trader Joe's/Whole Foods or popular grocery store + Starbucks + gyms + restaurants + public transportation\n\nBe a responsive landlord. Have a handyman and plumber on call and a lockbox onsite so they have access to the property. Happy tenants don't leave. There is no need to have a property manager nowadays. You can take care of your tenants problems at a distance. \n\nHere is a list of high cash-flow cities where property is usually cheap . In order of highest cash-flow\n\nFlint MI + Detroit MI + Youngstown OH + Gary IN + Muncie IN + Hammond IN + Reading PA+ Buffalo NY +  Canton OH + Cleveland OH + Dayton OH + Lansing MI +  Pittsburgh PA + Warner Robins GA + Deerfield Beach FL + South Bend IN + Akron OH + Largo FL + Evansville IN + Tamarac FL + Rochester NY + San Tan Valley AZ + Kokomo IN + Daytona FL + Waldorf MD\n\n\nThe GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier) values/ratios indicate how expensive is a city in relationship annual rent/ property price. These 35 cities in order from lower GRM (property price ) to higher but all under 15.

Near Starbucks is a seal of approval\n\nFlipping is another type of investing that is more along the get rich quick line of thinking\n\nBeware of (Buy Rehab, Rent, Refinance and Repeat) which is very popular in this subreddit.  Buy Rehab rent refinance assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans). Things can go wrong and you don't have a way to pay the hard money back. This is not for inexperienced investors unless you have your own money or another way to pay the loan if things don't go right .\n\nOthers recommend not putting more than 5% down when purchasing a property. Being heavily in debt is not a good idea when there is a crisis and you still have bills to pay but no income . It's better to have 20-40% per property.\n\nLastly HCOL markets rarely have properties that follow the 1% rule (monthly rent is 1% of purchase price) but have the possibility of appreciation.

Personally I have had plenty of success in the sector by identifying good values and avoiding irrational bubbles that formed. I invested in CGC at $3, but sold 90% of my shares in the $30 to $40 range because they were way too overvalued way too quickly. There\'s only one cannabis stock in my portfolio that isn\'t currently up at least 100% from my cost basis. Your point is like saying that because of the .com bubble popped you shouldn\'t have invested in internet stocks afterwards, which would be highly illogical when your investments should be based on looking forward while learning from the past, not ignoring the future because you handled the past poorly.\n\nYour point about Aurora is exactly the reason I like Vivo - Aurora over expanded, diluted into the bubble, and they grossly mismanaged the company by trying to grow too quickly. That\'s why millennials bought in obsessively and got burned. Meanwhile Vivo was not a popular stock because they didn\'t try to grow too quickly, they only grew the inventory they could sell. It\'s why they kept a strong cash position throughout the bubble popping while so many mismanaged cannabis companies disappeared. Their management team has a successful track record in the pharmaceutical industry and their CEO ran Teva Canada to great success in his 5 tenure. They know how to build revenue streams, create a product line, and grow a patient list.\n\nYou\'re obviously entitled to your opinion and I made it very clear that any small cap is risky in a volatile industry.

If you identified solid marijuana plays at good valuations you would not be in the red at all. If you bought into the bubble or ignored valuations then of course you got burned.\n\nI don\'t treat cannabis as a unique industry, but I acknowledge its large runway for growth into a $27 billion per year industry (per projections). You can say you\'re out because you made bad plays in the past, but personally I feel like you\'ll be ignoring fantastic opportunities in a quickly growing industry. Yes, there was a bubble and yes it popped, but now the dust is settling and what will be left are the well run companies with good management.

However, in April 2011, Branson announced further delays, saying “I hope 18 months from now, we’ll be sitting in our spaceship and heading off into space”.[19] By February 2012, SpaceShipTwo had completed 15 test flights attached to White Knight Two, and an additional 16 glide tests, the last of which took place in September 2011.[20] A rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo took place on 29 April 2013, with an engine burn of 16 seconds duration. The brief flight began at an altitude of 47,000 feet, and reached a maximum altitude of 55,000 feet. While the SS2 achieved a speed of Mach 1.2 (920 mph),[21] this was less than half the 2,000 mph speed predicted by Richard Branson. SpaceShipTwo\'s second supersonic flight achieved a speed of 1,100 mph for 20 seconds; while this was an improvement, it fell far short of the 2,500 mph for 70 seconds required to carry six passengers into space. However, Branson still announced his spaceship would be capable of ""launching 100 satellites every day"".[22]\n\n&gt; On 14 May 2013, Richard Branson stated on Virgin Radio Dubai\'s Kris Fade Morning Show that he would be aboard the first public flight of SpaceShipTwo, which had again been rescheduled, this time to December 25, 2013.[23] ""Maybe I’ll dress up as Father Christmas"", Branson said.[19] The third rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo took place on 10 January 2014 and successfully tested the spaceship\'s Reaction Control System (RCS) and the newly installed thermal protection coating on the vehicle\'s tail booms. Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said “We are progressively closer to our target of starting commercial service in 2014"".[24] Interviewed by The Observer at the time of her 90th birthday in July 2014, Branson\'s mother, Eve, told reporter Elizabeth Day of her intention of going to space herself. Asked when that might be, she replied: “I think it’s the end of the year”, adding after a pause, “It’s always ‘the end of the year’ ”.[25]\n\n&gt; In September 2014, Richard Branson described the intended date for the first commercial flight as February or March of 2015; by the time of this announcement, a new plastic-based fuel had yet to be ignited in-flight.[26] By September 2014, the three test flights of the SS2 had only reached an altitude of around 71,000 ft, approximately 13 miles; in order to receive a Federal Aviation Administration licence to carry passengers, the craft needs to complete test missions at full speed and 62-mile height. Following the announcement of further delays, UK newspaper The Sunday Times reported that Branson faced a backlash from those who had booked flights with Virgin Galactic, with the company having received $80 million in fares and deposits.[27] Tom Bower, author of Branson: The Man behind the Mask, told the Sunday Times: ""They spent 10 years trying to perfect one engine and failed. They are now trying to use a different engine and get into space in six months. It\'s just not feasible.""[28] BBC science editor David Shukman commented in October 2014, that ""[Branson\'s] enthusiasm and determination [are] undoubted. But his most recent promises of launching the first passenger trip by the end of this year had already started to look unrealistic some months ago.”[29]\n\n&gt; At 10:51 PST 31 October 2014, the fourth rocket-powered test flight of one of the company\'s SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS Enterprise, ended in disaster, as it broke apart in midair, with the debris falling into the Mojave desert in California, shortly after being released from the mothership. ... 39-year-old co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed and 43-year-old pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured.\n\nIt is now mid-2020.

So in retrospect it was actually not a bad idea to convert to bonds in 1998. However, you really would have wanted to convert back to equities in 2009 after the worst of the global financial crisis.

You see that always after the run up. I had extended family who kept asking me a lot of investment tips in March, April and May and shrugged off because I didn't have any stocks that were priced as penny stocks...they wanted those 1 dollar, 2 dollar 5 dollar stocks that they think will magically become a 100 bagger. I promised them that the market panic was an opportunity they will never get again in a very long time to buy bluechips that they knew so well. They're now asking the same questions again because the market has recovered. Those folks in my family know nothing about stocks, markets, funds, investing (they asked about penny stocks...so you get the point).

They want the bottom because they can't stand to buy a solid blue chip and see it go down 5% the next day. March was one of those times where stuff like that happened. That should tell you the panic is extreme. No one knows the bottom. That's why you have your watchlist of fundamentally sound cash rich businesses ready and you keep buying no matter what happens to the share price during a broad market sell off. If you buy now and it goes down by 10% next week. You don't regret buying it instead you buy more. And if it goes down again, you don't worry about your bad timing but keep buying.

2020-07-25,"[""Yeah I am the one living in that bubble, the market is a lie and so is every other metric. Everyone is suffering, because you are no longer making 6 figures\n\nDon't confuse your own personal experience with actual statisitic."", 'Short term Tesla appears driven by trolls as a momentum stock: when it\'s rising they expect more, pile in. Bad news/neg comments/short-selling peaks, they bail. You might get lucky chasing it; more likely you lose (general rule of gambling - stock mkt included - is the house wins, not you).\n\nLong term Tesla is priced like it\'s going to crush GM, Ford, Toyota... half the auto sector. Maybe, but not for a long time. Price includes substantial profitability years out - &amp; wall street doesn\'t hold that long. So it\'s way too high, as a value buy. And mid-term it\'s pretty dependent on words/health of one guy: Elon Musk. He appears healthy but is pretty mercurial. Wouldn\'t bet against him: he\'s Henry Ford &amp; Thos. Edison rolled into one, but he\'s still a wild card. So I\'d treat an investment in TSLA as highly speculative, bit of a gamble, and one you leave for years - unless something happens to EM.\n\nThe other way to view it is as a speculative buy on consumer electrification &amp; line extension: he\'s building mass battery storage (prior used Panasonic but now building own supply: Megapack), &amp; is integrating vertically by investing in long-term lithium supply. Also major mover in consumer solar supply (SolarCity) once roofing product ramps up. This view was promoted by Ch. of Virgin Galactic a couple of days ago. Consumer EVs, E-Trucks, consumer batteries (Powerwall) and Solar Roofing: there\'s diversification as well as line extension across industries. Incredibly cool, far-sighted &amp; possibly an empire in the making: like buying GE in 1940, but better. Or it\'s massively ambitious with the potential for over-reach &amp; crash all too likely. \n\nLots of what-ifs here. What usually brings down gutsy bet-the-ranch gambles is unexpected market changes that affect intended market or cost of funds. Examples: Motorola\'s gamble on Iridium (tanked the company when the dot-com bubble burst); the Reichmann Brothers\' Canary Wharf development (tanked the company when interest rates suddenly spiked). Both were breath-takingly brilliant gambles that should have made billions; you wouldn\'t have wanted to be an investor in either after they crashed &amp; burned. At the time I would have bought if I\'d had the money. Both ventures worked, but the firms that made money were the ones that bought them in bankruptcy. The visionaries had crashed.\n\nSo the question then is whether COVID-19 pandemic will disrupt market sufficiently to stall consumer electrification (who do you know who wants to invest $30-60K in a new roof with a 6-8 year payback?), E-Trucking (will business slow-down slow commercial investments in logistics?), EVs (will consumers have money or confidence to invest in Powerwall &amp;/or a new car?), interest rates (if they zing up, how long can Tesla sustain the capital burn?) &amp; geo-politics (growth in China balances US growth, unless US really pisses off the Chinese &amp; they slam Tesla). Apple sells a high-end consumer product but has lots of cash &amp; can ride out a market down-turn. Tesla products are all a much bigger investment; does it have the cash to survive? Can Elon keep it up or will he crash &amp; burn?\n\nDon\'t ask Wall Street. Long-term for Wall Street isn\'t even Tuesday; it\'s 2 pm this afternoon. Zero faith, even interest, in backing vision. And the market always assumes everything will continue, til it doesn\'t - then over-reacts. Market says interest rates will stay &lt;2% forever (""Free money!""); I\'ve seen 25% &amp; know it can happen. \n\nMaybe Musk will pull it off. No one else has ever succeeded in running so many different business start-ups in so many different industries - at the same time no less - and some are already quite profitable. In particular, SpaceX - but it\'s not part of Tesla &amp; not likely to ever go public (though Google\'s 7.5% interest in it adds a little boost to Alphabet stock).\n\nTesla\'s a gamble. We all want him to succeed. If you\'re young perhaps it\'s worth the long-term hold &amp; gamble - but give thought to how much of your funds you want to put at risk.

If I was choosing who to bailout, they’d be near the top based on that alone. No need to buy more planes, less maintenance, etc. etc.\n\nOf course that is a bit double-edged.

They'll take on debt, and eventually that debt bubble may pop. Then the government will bail out the lenders instead of the borrowers. China still has a lot of lower income people, and the Chinese govt is very much interested in helping them reach the middle class.  To me this means, long term, their domestic consumption will rise and since China is a huge country, it will be able to supply for a lot of that consumption domestically. I don't think China is interested in letting capital capture their government, and I think that means stability in the long term. I also feel China's govt is more interested in the long game and is better focused on preparing for climate change. The American govt is run by wealthy people who couldn't care less if the United States burns, as they can hop on private jets and leave, or hire guards to protect their gated neighborhoods.

I\'m looking to get the most out of the project and how I can use it to maximize returns.\n\nBasically, I built an analysis tool that takes in a large number of technical indicators over about 6 years and generates trading ""strategies"" for a given security. I\'ve been hesitant to put any real money behind these strategies because I\'m a hobbyist with just enough information to be dangerous so the risk feels high. That said, after pretty extensive backtesting and fine tuning, I\'m pretty sure I can predict whether a security will go up or down with 60-70% accuracy. I\'m pretty happy with that.\n\nI backtested this on a few stocks, though, and I\'m not seeing the returns I would hope. For example, I tested this on AT&amp;T. Between January 2013 and this month, my back testing shows a 276% return (on average 3.1% / month). On one hand, the price of the stock declined 14% over that same period, so I\'m way over performing that. But I read these ""success"" stories about 1000% returns which are probably super rare so maybe my perspective is skewed in a bad way.\n\nI tested this on other securities as well (GE, WFC, BAC) and while specific results vary, the overall trend seems to be successful.

On one hand, the price of the stock declined 14% over that same period, so I\'m way over performing that.

The money is being printed, definitely, but it\'s also not being released into the wild, and it\'s really uncharted waters in that EVERYONE knows exactly what is happening with unlimited QE, but it\'s just there is no alternative if you want yield on your money. It\'s hard to understate the significance of this. Inflation and its effects on equities are typically the purview of people who work in the field. Never has it been so public like this. That really throws the traditional playbook out the window. It may sound a little stupid but ""the number of market participants who are aware of a certain phenomenon"" is really a big factor in how ""priced in"" that phenomenon is. My feeling is that this bubble still has a ways to go, we\'re just getting started. It takes time for this stuff to fester. I also think, memes aside, Powell is really a master economist. He knows this is inflating the shit out of equities and you can bet he has a plan to bring it down gradually. He\'s not a trader, he is thinking long term. The part about Powell you have to understand is that he takes independence of the Fed really to heart and his only concern is the health of the economy. It\'s well documented that he was against QE before the pandemic, but it really speaks to his ability that he was able to recognize the situation quickly for what it was, and was willing to adapt to the circumstances and change his view to match reality at a critical time. That kind of awareness, in an industry full of big egos, is really, really fucking rare.

The guy I responded to is saying ""Uber and Lyft going away is not a good thing,"" and I\'m asking, well, for whom? Riders and shareholders, sure, but what about drivers? Look, I spent a long time in the restaurant industry, doing everything from dishwasher to owner, and if there\'s one thing I learned, it\'s that there are certain industries which are built upon the backs of its labor force. Rideshare seems to be bubbling into a similar situation. You raise a bunch of money and predicate your successful business model upon paying your employees like shit, and when it doesn\'t work out, the business closes and everyone is fired. The only way to avoid it is to train the public that going out to eat and paying everyone a living wage is actually pretty damn expensive, which contracts the business as a whole because all of a sudden you can\'t get by on a shitty experience. If you\'re paying $20 for what used to be a $10 burger, you\'d better feel like it\'s worth it. So I\'m asking it here - is the better answer for our society as a whole for the courts to take the legally correct definition of ""independent contractor"" and force the companies like Uber and Lyft to pay what they\'re supposed to be paying, not only to the drivers in question but to the federal government, OR do we keep looking at each other hoping Uber and Lyft aren\'t going to eventually collapse (through continued court decisions like this, outright bans, or equalized autonomous fleet maintenance expenses) because we like our taxis cheap now, damn it, because that\'s what\'s best for shareholders and riders, totally ignoring that those who drive for a living being suddenly unemployed will ALSO be a big problem?', ""I already own at least $20k each of AZN, PFE, GILD, ABBV, ABT and GSK, so I wouldn't be buying anything.

Look at climate change for example, which is an existential threat not just to the economy, but our lives, lol. Even in the countries that believe it's real, it's hard to get action on the issue. I find it very unlikely that there would be enough traction within governments to ban freedom of speech like that. In this time where a lot of people are not trusting the government, do you really think people are just going to accept this ban is for their own good? \n\nNation-states also exist in competition with each other and while some countries may have an incentive to ban Bitcoin, that also creates an incentive for other countries to embrace it.\n\nCountries also have a fear of being left behind, in both the monetization of a new asset class, as well as the emergence of a new technological wave. Imagine the countries that missed the internet wave because they discarded it? I think that left a huge scar on countries that didn't take the internet seriously. And that's why you see countries nowadays being very afraid of banning crypto companies and making the environment too hostile for them could just stifle innovation.\n\nA lot of it is Bitcoin and crypto having that positive PR and especially use-cases where people can see the good it can do in their life, that way there will be no public support for a ban. Things like better lobbying and getting more power players more interested in crypto, your mainstream politicians, business executives, financiers, and so on would go a long way. And at that point, Bitcoin will be so entrenched into the system, that it is no longer easy to obviate. \n\n&gt; Due to it being deflationary means people would just want to hoard it, which will hurt economy. \n\nGold is also deflationary and it being available to be traded doesn't hurt the economy. If it's threatening the USD, it will have to be being used in day-to-day transactions, as you say, deflationary currencies are less likely to be used in day-to-day transactions. As my first sentence read, I don't see Bitcoin or any deflationary currency as being a threat to USD, I see an inflationary currency with Bitcoin as its gold standard being the real threat to USD because of its inflationary nature, and the value it will bring to the people that use it in transactions vs. USD.\n\nA currency only ever threatens fiat by being used more than fiat in transactions, and *helping* the economy grow. By the time governments realize it's a threat it will be too late because it will be a significant percentage of the economy and people are already finding it useful. Again, governments will want to compete with it and try to provide better incentives to use fiat rather than ban it.\n\n&gt; It takes always less resources to have centralized system as opposed to decentralized. \n\nIt depends what you mean by decentralized. I would imagine the datacenters needed to handle such large-scale transactions will look the same as Amazon and Microsoft's datacenters now. What makes it decentralized will be that the protocol isn't controlled or owned by anyone, permissionless, and with a high assurance that your transactions won't be censored, much like the protocols the internet runs on.\n\n&gt; You do need crypto to have near 0 fees for transactions. \n\nI assume you mean that you do *not* need crypto for near zero fee transactions? I mentioned this. There will be competition. Banks might be able to survive by basically becoming a platform for these digital services, thereby eliminating most of their profits, but they could make money from offering customer service, especially for the tech illiterate, something like AOL. They will have to adapt quickly and slim down, and that's hard for big organizations to do. If this is what becomes of banks, I doubt many would have any problems with it.

This is why he often releases these long run sort of philosophical takes on markets and macroeconomics, it's also why he's got a few very dumbed down educational videos.  The thing with the portfolio specifically is way back when Tony Robbins interviewed him for Tony's book and Ray basically bought in to Tony's BS - note Ray didn't actually create this portfolio but did kinda indicate that yeah, risk party moves in and out of assets based on their volatility and valuations, and that the portfolio does have the core tenants of the asset classes risk parity moves in and out of.  But these funds are all basically static allocations with no leverage which entirely defeats the purpose of risk parity which both uses varying amounts of leverage on a daily/weekly basis and moves between the asset classes dynamically based on volatility and a number of other factors.\n\nOne can read up on it here: https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/the-all-weather-story\n\nand perhaps a bit more technical white paper on risk parity in general here: https://images.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity.pdf\n\nIt would be basically impossible to implement an actual risk parity approach in a 40 act fund.

It\'s down since then. You\'re welcome.\n\nI did a quick look at the numbers for Intel and AMD and Nvidia. The growth expected for AMD and Nvidia hasn\'t shown up in the numbers yet. So I\'m curious how this will all play out. Chips have always been a very competitive business. And how does it play out if/when Intel farms out manufacturing to Taiwan like all the others? They all are basically design shops that send the making elsewhere. Is this good or bad, not sure.\n\nAnd what is the future of chips? Will our machines become dumb terminals and only need ARM because all the processing is done in the cloud? How will autonomous vehicles and such impact all this? We\'re only going to have more devices in the future that need chips of some sort. Think of how many billions of people still don\'t have ""computers"".

It has introduced a new product niche and is growing very rapidly (Beyond Meat perhaps). The company is not yet profitable and has no debt. In your DCF you need to take the company from young fast-growing unprofitable company in a new niche to a larger, profitable, mature company in a now well competed product category. Although the company has no debt you expect it to become profitable and therefore the company is likely to issue debt to lower its cost of capital and enjoy the tax deductible nature of interest. Other mature packaged goods companies have between 40% and 60% debt in their capital structure so you assume it will have 50%. \n\nCurrently the WACC is just the cost of equity which say is 8%. As you introduce debt into the capital structure at some future year, the WACC has to change regardless of changes in the interest rate environment. When it initially issues debt you think it will be slightly profitable and not yet investment grade, so it will have a BB rating because it will only slightly cover its interest payments. The cost of BB paper will be 6% over treasuries. You will also have to recalculate the cost of equity by re-levering the beta in that year and that cost of equity will rise though WACC may decline very slightly overall because you use the after tax cost of debt. You assume the company becomes more profitable, covers it debt by larger degrees and its rating goes to investment grade, maybe A rated terminally and a 2% spread. Each year you must recalculate the new cost of debt because the spread will decline with the higher rating and larger sales base and cost of equity will likely continue to rise but WACC will be declining so those later cash flows will be discounted at the lower WACC. \n\nThe PV of cash flows will have many different WACCs depending on year. The terminal value will be discounted at the terminal WACC. Although you are discounting future cash flows assuming new debt, there are no current debt-holders that are superior to you in the capital structure at the IPO. Therefore your EV will be the value to equity holders. \n\nYou accounted for the new debt issuances by modifying your WACC in those future years. There should also be a feedback loop for investment rate, growth, and capital required to invest. So you will actually also account for the debt issuance in the investment rate and future growth assuming it isn't strictly for capital structure modification purposes. Alternatively you can use a FCFE model and add the issuances to the cash flows attributable to equity holders but then discount those cash flows at the cost of equity rather than WACC which will rise as you leverage the company later in the projected periods. If done correctly the two values should be approximately equal."", ""deflation and inflation afterwards.

I am a swing trader and would love to give you a brief outline of the things I've found useful! \n\nThe system I use essentially boils down to these things: Trendlines (And all the things used in variation with trendlines), Moving Averages, Price Levels, occasionally RSI-MACD, Dips + sideways movements, Trends in timeframes, Stock Formations, and Candlestick charting.\n\nTrendlines are pretty basic and by itself shouldn't need me to prove or explain. There are other types of trendlines though like speed lines, price levels, other things I'm forgetting the name of so you should research this topic. Very useful, very common. \n\nMoving averages. I use 50,100,200 day moving averages. They're mostly useful in clear trends that move for long periods in a certain direction, and they are simple things I keep an eye on at all times. An easy example would be AAPL from Nov. 2016 to Aug. 2018. You will see within that range that there are many instances which the price of the stock hitting the MA lines and moving up from there. Not always, but there is a trend. \n\nPrice levels are just points that the price of the stock has hit recently or in the past, or multiple times in the past. Lows, highs, sideways movements. I might list those instances as vertical lines on a chart just to illustrate the potential troughs a stock could end up in and change trend. By itself, this isn't a buying indicator, but I use it often in conjunction with other trends. \n\nRSI MACD I mostly use to keep an eye on longer term trends. I know a lot of people like this but I only use it occasionally. \n\nMany times there are Dips that happen in the market that can be observed, an ebb and a flow of the stock moving up and down with sideways movement. A recent example would be D. July 7th, it dips down sharply. By july 14th it's been trading sideways and is even accompanied by some spinning tops and Doji Stars. A dip + a candlestick formation. Now the stock is trading at around $82. You can look in this stocks history and see many examples of sharp dips followed by some or even no sideways consolidation, then sharp moves up. \n\nIf you look at different timeframes, you can see a finer vision of potentially entry points and trends. The 5 minute, 15 min, hourly, and Daily are pretty much the only time-frames I use. \n\nStock Formations are KILLER. A recent example I profited off of was AIG. There was a triangle-like formation across many stocks and sectors. This stock in particular was looking like a pretty clear Ascending triangle and the book  I was reading said they often are bullish and that they often retract shortly after breaking out. Surely enough from the 22nd - 27th there was a break out, then a dip from the 28th - 29th. Literally textbook example. I bought the dip and rode that up. :'D That was a trade I was proud of. (I'll list some books and resources below, don't worry). \n\nPretty much the most important tool I use is candlestick charting and formations. Doji stars, hammers, hanging men, shooting stars, 3 soldiers formation, engulfing patterns, many more! I use these like stop signs indicating trend-changes. \n\nThere are a couple books and places I've learned these things. If you want a simple book that lays out the basics of technical analysis, there's this book I got called Charting and Technical Analysis by Fred Mcallen. it's pretty basic, nothing groundbreaking or new but I thought it layed out the basics of TA reasonably well. \n\nThe second book is much denser but is a bible. Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by John J Murphy. The most comprehensive book I've ever got my hands on, but it's a long read. I'd recommend this only to a beginnerwho has read the previous book.\n\nThe third book is Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques by Steve Nison. Another bible. These books together are AMAZING. I highly recommend. Word under the tree is you can get these pretty easily if you search around, if you catch my drift. \n\nBesides that for a long time I just searched everything related to Technical Analysis and just soaked everything up. The chartguys on youtube have great lessons as well. Look them up. \n\n------\n\nThe reasons I swing trade is because it's a nice time frame that I feel I can be engaged with the stock market on a weekly basis but not feel the stress of having to react quickly as a day-trader. It's easier to breathe and stop and digest what's happening, and hopefully not be emotional with my decisions. The ideal experation dates for option contracts I've found to be from 45-100 days out, just depending on what's going on with each option market and stock. That time frame usually means that the Theta isn't going to kill me too quickly, and also that I've got some breathing room when stocks trade sideways. I don't trade weekly options, that is what usually kills me. \n\nThe greeks are VERY important. It's kind of a lot for me to put down here, but the big three are Delta (Rate of Price Change), Gamma (Rate of change for Delta), and Theta (Daily Time decay). Look them up and understand what they mean for the value of the option as the stock price changes. \n\n-------\n\nAnyways, this is just a rough outline of the technical tools I use to trade. There are of course many other things such as strategy, risk management, managing emotions and you should search on youtube about these things to see what other traders have to say (Claytrader,chartguys, etc)  because I'm sorry but I've written a lot here lol I'm a bit drained. \n\nI'm no master trader though. My account fluctuates. I make mistakes. I've only been trading for a year and a half but I can hold my ground. If I lose money, I don't even fret because I've experienced and profited off many opportunities. I Certainly hope to become a better trade, but I can honestly tell you the tools I've outlined here have been extremely helpful in trades I've profited off of. But if you're not disciplined and don't have or follow rules to mitigate risk, you will likely lose money. \n\nHope this was helpful!"", ""It's very iffy time right now.

If MLB and any other other sports cancelled their season, it would mean a rockier road ahead for GAN intermediately, and create selling momentum for the short term.  I have no data to prove it but that's my perspective - share pricing was counting on a bounce from the return of sports and even the threat of that being present is enough to scare off any short-term commitments."", 'That was DC police, those were not federal police for the photo op and in case you forgot they set a fire in the church so it’s understandable why police would move in.

Possibly the calls just aren't worth it in the risk/reward calculus- I haven't researched in depth how much that actually adds to return. Might be the case that is busy-work and not worth the time.\n\nMy gut feeling is that we're in for a few years of sluggish growth because so much of the market performance is detached from how the average person is doing on the street.

Eg. CloudFront + WAF, Route53, etc. But in the industry I generally see the AWS alternatives only being used by companies whose infrastructure is already with AWS. \n\nCloudflare is usually an easier/better fit for anyone *not* already deploying to AWS, or if you need features that AWS doesn’t yet have. For example, someone running a blog that suddenly gets a lot of traffic can easily point DNS to Cloudflare and take advantage of their services in a matter of minutes. With AWS, it would be an all day process. And on top of that, Cloudflare has AWS beat when it comes to security, DDoS mitigation, and some other features.\n\nI think Cloudflare is already too respected and widely used by engineers to be gobbled up by any other company. \n\nDisclaimer: I very recently started holding positions in NET. I was actually very surprised to see that it was seen as an ‘up-and-coming cloud service’ in a lot of the investment subreddits, because in the IT field it has been a huge player for quite a while. When Cloudflare goes down, everyone and their grandma notices since so many sites depend on it. Definitely a solid company with massive growth potential.', 'Your first point is the largest issue I believe. In my experience, the premiums on those types of tickers are relatively low - which is fine. Sell contracts by the dozens to make any fees negligible. But, the issue lies when you sell you monthly/quarterly/whatever covered call and the price of the underlying goes up.\n\nUsing XBB as en example. It is relatively stable in the long term, which is expected. But, when you have short term volatility or other issues with traditional indexes (looking st SPY as a prime example) - bond funds typically spike in conjunction with market volatility. Although they tend to spike up rather than down as people shift their money into safer assets.\n\nThose upward spikes are where a large portion of your long term gains will be. By selling covered calls, everything there is a positive spike in your bond fund - you will be assigned and your gains wiped out. It may be worth it depending on your premiums sold in the months/years beforehand. Not saying there is no money to be made, just pointing out the (conservative) risk. Money invested on Jan 1st, 2020 in XBB would actually be up around 6% i just the past 7 months. If you were to invest at the bottom of the trough in mid-March 2020 - you would be up 17% by now. I know this is cherry-picking examples but you get the point. By selling covered calls, you will almost definitely miss out on most of those gains. This may be okay, but read below for another hypothetical.\n\nI think the way to approach this would to take XBB (for example) and look as its annualized gains after dividends. Since its inception (2006) it is sitting at 5.34% annualized. Your goal would be to write calls (lets say monthly) that can produce .5% per month so you\'ll end up with 6% annually - or quarterly calls that can produce 1.5% - or whatever amount of time you want to write your calls for. The issues here are plenty.\n\n* You may get assigned before dividends are paid which would possibly eat into your profit.\n* You may also decide this is a 10 year plan, but halfway through you cant write the same calls for the same premiums and you\'re forced to sell at a loss and try a new strategy, or to abandon your plan.\n* You may not even be able to sell calls worth selling without taking on uncompensated risk.\n\nEither way there is an element of unpredictability that you may or may not be compensated for when writing your calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I JUST REREAD YOUR POST AND MISREAD ALL OF IT. I will keep my above part as is because I think it is worth reading, but here are my actual thoughts on your post.\n\nYour idea is flawed in its entirety... sort of. If you are buying into companies to write covered calls - this is a common strategy and has pros and cons of course. You will need to look into the intricacies of selling covered calls to make it efficient. Writing calls is usually a profitable venture in general, but it is a very tough game to out perform the underlying stock you are writing calls against in the long term. And if you cannot out perform the underlying, there is not really a point unless it is acting as a measured hedge.\n\nIt sounds like you are just using your bond fund to act as a savings account in the meantime to build capital. This is actually totally fine as well and frankly not even a bad idea. You are essentially re-balancing your portfolio as time goes on between stocks and bonds.\n\nI think the largest and most alarming red-flag is your idea to just  *""To start off, getting 100 shares each in a few companies with decent dividends""* . Everybody knows this is a good idea, but the reality is picking companies that perform well is literally the single hardest thing someone can do in the market. What if you drop your money into a few companies and they immediately start trending down for months/years? Yeah, that is unlikely, and yes you can just sell covered calls and collect premiums with no worry of getting assigned. But then you are just stuck holding onto a very volatile portfolio until you can add to your bonds. On the bright side, your bonds may see good returns while your stocks are volatile. But those returns may be well overshadowed by the 100\'s of shares in equities vs your handfuls of shares of bonds.\n\nHopefully someone else can contribute to this as well for more insight.', 'it’s a good question but no one wants to talk about the valuation bubbles the fed has created.', ""You're so sure that we're at the peak of a bubble that you won't invest (in any company?), yet you also won't buy a put?

However as stated previously this is VERY new tech relatively speaking and there are already projects out that have several better attributes than BTC in terms of scalability/security/utility. If I had to place bets though, Id say BTC dominates the market for the next decade or so due to the fact that your average person doesn't know much about crypto and if the TV tells them to buy, they just go and buy, they don't bother looking at other solutions within the crypto ecosystem. After the full potential is realized BTC will still retain value similarly how gold does but it will not be #1 in market cap as we move through generations in this industry.\n\nForgot to answer part of your question.

The SPX grows at the rate of inflation, all other things equal. Then on top of that, it should grow at the rate of growth of the economy, or about 2%.   Then it might grow a bit on top of that, if corporations grab some non-corporate GDP growth (ie, workers get less, corporations get more).  Then it should grow at the rate of long term interest rates, with some risk premium.  This amounts to a nominal (not real) growth of at least 4% per annum, or a doubling every 18 years.  *But this assumes that no intermediate crash sets the clock back.*\n\nBut you should think hard (and comment carefully) on the following conundrum:  how do you expect stocks to grow much faster than the US economy?  Do you expect lower and lower returns (higher PE)?  To me, this is an unsustainable bubble.  Or do you expect corporations to grab GDP away from workers and small businesses?  Or do you expect international expansion to make up for slow US GDP growth?

The exact numbers 18 and 26 are not crucial, so it's not a case of fine-tuning.  This  strategy beats both lump sum buy and hold, and incremental dollar cost averaging.

As such we've had a major decline in interest rates and a major increase in total debt. This has been a world wide event, not just the US central bank. What this means is the money supply has gone through the roof despite real economy growth being unimpressive. So where has all this money gone? The financial and asset markets . Prices up, yields down, across the board. Bonds up, yields almost zero. Stocks up, yields low single digits. Real estate up, same. In fact, the financial markets have benefitted from a 40 year decline in interest rates, and now we're at zero. Prolonged zero. \n\nYou see, interest rates drive expected returns for all investments. As the Fed has driven rates to near zero, along with all other major central banks, at least a few of them adopting negative rate policies - -  real rates are negative pretty much everywhere - - prices get bid up. What that means is as expected returns on bonds are slightly positive to negative, so is the case with stocks. But you say prices are rising so people expect higher returns. But that is just the opposite of how the math works. The more you pay, the lower your expected return, all else equal. And given that companies as a whole have had subpar growth going on a decade now, yet stock prices are at ATH and continuing to grow, particularly in tech, that means investors are expecting lower and lower returns going forward. And the minute rates start to rise, assuming they are ever again allowed to, you should expect all of this to reverse. Higher rates means lower prices. The only way that isn't true is we would need uncomfortable levels of inflation. And if that happens we have a whole host of other problems to contend with."", ""When I first found out about this, I wasn't really shocked, because I don't really go on TikTok because it's not my thing.

TikTok is a social media platform that is shrowd with controversy (Microsoft isn't keen on such) with it being banned in some countries, government agencies and companies demanding it be removed immediately off work devices and also flogged as Chinese spyware. So it's a murky deal going in but a popular app nonetheless.\n\nThis would have made SOME sense if we were in 2014 with Windows Phone. Microsoft since 2015 has shed itself from their previous consumer offerings such as Groove Music, W10M and Phones, MSN Health+Fitness and HealthVault, as well as canning almost all of the physical retail stores that were recently oriented towards (very) SMB customers as that was actually where a chunk of sales were legit coming from. \n\nMicrosoft's growth the past few years and ESPECIALLY recently has been dominant with the enterprise and SMB sectors. Consumer products and services aren't where Satya is focused on much at all. Like, Surface nearly was on the chopping block in 2014 if it wasn't a knock out it turned out to be. And to this day, they're focusing on doing what Dell and HPE do with enterprise oriented hardware sales as again, larger revenue streams than consumer.\n\nXbox is obviously their main consumer product and service that is a bright spot here. LinkedIn is more or less a service internally at Microsoft we don't know how money is made off the platform (and also doubles as our job listings board internally that we didn't need to build up from scratch). Not a social media platform really though. Microsoft has dabbled in projects like SoCl before where it was a Pinterest style platform.\n\nThis buyout, I don't unterstand where the tie in could be. As we did with Skype, it got rebranded as Lync for many years and Skype still is around for consumers but included with Office 365. I just don't see where they can realistically add this into an existing service or product to enhance an offering. It very much makes me think this is a foreray into social media, which...ok? If they are doing that, what a weird time to that. Microsoft has a stance of privacy focus and if this gets used for marketing and advertising, that negates a bit of that perceived trust people have with Microsoft. We really don't have a good advertising platform in part due to us not going so hardcore with connecting user data dots across people's devices like Google and Facebook do.\n\nI'm also wondering if Microsoft is trying to play the savior role and being the reason it's not banned in the US, I guess it'll score them brownie points. It'll possibly outshine Snap with SnapChat and stick it to them for being the reason in part Windows Phone failed to grow as Snap refused to even bother with Microsoft.

It was just over 10 years ago when people were paying nearly $5.00 per gallon and if you had said you will be paying under $2.00 a decade from now people would have told you that you must mean $12.00. If you want to be more extreme you could say in 400 AD the idea that the Roman Empire would not exist would have been unthinkable.

expected to happen(see tesla if you are convinced they are going to fall). \n\nthird the drop may not be as long as you predicted(see every 1% drop in tesla). \n\nfourth implied volatility can already have priced(see tesla maybe with it 50%ish IV on atm puts). if it is widely perceived to be a bubble the IV on the puts will be high increasing their price. once the stock goes down the IV may in fact lower causing the puts to reduce in value which can reduce the profit or in some cases even make it unprofitable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat said it can be valid but you need to consider the likelihood of the drop, how much the drop will be, the timing of the drop, and if he potential drop is already factored into the price of the puts via IV.', 'I\'m saying a number of things, but as far as what directly involves investing, I\'m not only saying they don\'t buy in meaningful numbers, I\'m also saying the message alienates general audiences. \n\nTake the MCU. It practically prints money just because it has a gigantic meta-arc and brings together all sorts of characters and universes into a single continuity. The first movie, before anyone even really knew what the MCU was, was a smash hit, with a box office revenue of ~600 Million USD. I remember seeing it and not even realizing that Spider man, Hulk, and Iron man, were all in the same universe by virtue of having been made by Marvel. \n\nThen comes The Avengers, and the MCU is finally established as a thing. It gets triple the revenue and this trend holds for practically the rest of the saga. Then comes Captain Marvel. It was so well advertised that even I heard about this movie, which, for context, I hadn\'t heard of anything past The Avengers until I got slapped with CM and looked back to see what I\'d missed. We\'re well into the cannon, setting up for Endgame, and if you don\'t watch this, you\'ll sit there wondering who the flying lady is. What do we get? Mediocre reviews that Rotten tomatoes [immediately deletes](https://cosmicbook.news/rotten-tomatoes-deletes-captain-marvel-user-reviews#:~:text=The%20controversy%20surrounding%20Captain%20Marvel,which%20affects%20the%20Audience%20Score.), artificially inflating the score. \n\nSo after intense advertising, setting the movie up as ""required reading"", suppressing negative reviews, and so on, this ""female empowerment"" fantasy manages to lose at least 200 Million dollars over a similarly positioned movie like Black Panther (which was, as far as I could tell, not as well advertised, didn\'t shove the race card down my throat every two seconds, and no reviews were removed). So we can probably come to a few conclusions here, mainly that either audiences hate women more than they hate blacks, or that sitting around rubbing an unlikeable ""strong female character"" in our faces in a badly made propaganda movie is the best way to lose out on money.', 'This is true and a function of how our society is structured by the way.  Just think about it.\n\nFirst point: Existing wealthy people have a large majority of their wealth in stocks.  They have a vested interest in making sure that their investments do well.  This is why you see laws and policy decisions in the government directly structured to benefit the stock market.\n\nSecond point:  It is in the nature of capitalism to pay employees the lowest amount of money possible.  The logical effects of this being that anyone trying to get wealthy via work or being paid will have an uphill struggle to do so.\n\nWith this being known, the logical conclusion is people should only work hard in order to obtain a salary that allows you to build capital.  Once you have this, all your efforts should rotate from work to learning how to invest and investing.\n\nEssentially the goal should be to take advantage of the ""path"" that wealthy people have created by exploiting the benefits of the tax and stimulus systems that they have lobbied to put into place.', ""Their subscription model is pretty good. They basically grabbed that old statistics that a lot of people who pay for a gym membership don't go to the gym and applied it to a home workout."", 'A lot of these companies have not done anything to justify a 50% increase from pre-covid levels. IMO the stimulus checks and FOMO are driving the tech bubble.', ""Am I the only one who feels like we're in a monster tech bubble right now? Not just with the titans but so many others have gone up 50%+ higher than before covid for no particular reason."", 'yep. 3 generations ago was the great depression (more or less), the family wealth at that point would have been wiped out.\n\nThere is also a chance it got wiped out in the SL crisis, the oil shortages, the 07 crash, the corona mess, the dot com bubble, or countless other issues during that time.', ""I'm not saying we're in for another market crash, but the rise in SPACs could be compared to Tulipmania (first modern market crash), the increased use of margin (1929 crash), the .com bubble, and many more examples that I could name.\n\nBe careful with these companies. Many SPACs are trading far above their expected valuations post reverse-merger."", ""One caveat to this: if it's a market order then the order will continue to eat up the book until it's filled. Only a limit order will restrict you from paying different prices if you can't be filled by the NBBO (national best bid/offer). \n\nIn other words, OP, if you are buying say 1000 shares and you want to buy at $10.00, and there's 500 offered on the ask at $10.00, 200 at the next ask at $10.05, then 500 at $10.10, with a market order you will get 500 at $10.00, 200 at $10.05 and 300 at $10.10, leaving 200 on the offer at $10.10. That gives you an average price of (500 * $10.00 + 200 * $10.05 + 300 * $10.10) = $10,040 / 1000 = $10.04.\n\nIf you use a limit order at, e.g., $10.00, you will get the 500 at $10.00 and the rest of your order will become a 500 share bid at $10.00. The next offer at $10.05 will have to change to meet your $10.00, or someone else will have to come in and sell more at $10.00 to continue filling your order. If you were to use a limit order at $10.05 then you would get the 500 at $10.10 and the 200 at $10.05 and have 300 left unfilled as a bid at $10.05 with the offer at $10.10. \n\nThis is why big market orders and marketable limit orders (e.g. people saying fuck it, get me in/out, I don't care about the price) make stocks move up/down quickly. They wipe out the entire order book and push the price higher/lower. It's also how manipulators can flash a big bid or big offer with confidence that it won't fill and scare people into buying/selling/canceling their orders on the book. For example, assume in the above scenario instead of buying 1000 shares you set a limit at $10.00 to buy 50,000. You know there's only 500 shares on the offer, so in this case you would buy the 500 at $10.00, leaving a 45,500 share bid on the order book at $10.00 which tells people there's a big buyer out there and can entice them to buy. Beware though ... it's possible (and common) for there to be orders not shown on the book, so being too brazen trying to push the market by flashing big bids and offers can leave you holding a huge bag if there's someone out there who actually wants to match your trade ;) \n\nNot sure you needed all that info but hey, now you have it lol"", 'The first thing people give up with increasing cost of living is the future.  Savings rates go down so the lifestyle does not have to go down.\n\nI have had this conversation with my wife multiple times.  I feel that the definition of middle class now is the ability to retire at 65 and live a comfortable lifestyle until death (draw 50k or so a year).  Not the fantastic amazing retirement full of travel, but a decent place to live, a few bucks to spend on hobbies or eating out.\n\nI know people who make big bucks but save nothing and will not be able to retire, and then there are lower paying jobs with pensions that are perfect to retire off of.   It is not how much you make, it is your ability to have the american dream.', ""Facebook became a giant echo chamber. There isn't even a trending section or anything that might even potentially cause you to glance an opinion outside of your own. It's a site that you perfectly curate to only show you exactly what you want to see. Twitter has that to an extent by following specific people, but there is still trending that let's you step outside of your bubble."", 'Bro u think those revenue justifies the market cap? I love lisa su though, but it seems like somewhat of a bubble, margin hasnt improved either.. But i get it, future looks bright considering how shitty intc has became', ""&gt; different brokers are not necessarily connected to each other\n\nSo there's no SIP feed for extended hours? So when you submit an order you have to choose which exchange to route it to instead of NBBO?"", 'The issue isn’t the people who have invested over the past 5 years. It’s all the new retail investors that just jumped in this year. They are going to get clobbered. \n\nI remember seeing a Jeff Bezos interview where he talked about amazon in 2000. It went from $113 in 1999 to $6 at the end of 2000. But the entire time that happened he was watching the companies internal metrics and every single one showed the company was doing better and better and making more and more money.\n\nHis takeaway from this was “The company is not the stock and the stock is not the company” companies like AMZN or MSFT can easily do great numbers and still see their share price drop considerably.', '**AwesomeMathUse**, kminder in **5 months** on [**2021-01-04 10:54:04Z**](https://www.reminddit.com/time?dt=2021-01-04 10:54:04Z&amp;reminder_id=c77eb658c1bf4e04a46561ad7fc24498&amp;subreddit=investing)\n\n&gt; [**r/investing: The_underrated_stock_survey_submit_your_picks_for**](/r/investing/comments/i2thge/the_underrated_stock_survey_submit_your_picks_for/g0bbuoe/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=remindditbot&amp;subject=Reminder%20from%20Link&amp;message=your_message%0Akminder%202021-01-04T10%3A54%3A04%0A%0A%0A%0A---Server%20settings%20below.%20Do%20not%20change---%0A%0Apermalink%21%20%2Fr%2Finvesting%2Fcomments%2Fi2thge%2Fthe_underrated_stock_survey_submit_your_picks_for%2Fg0bbuoe%2F) to also be reminded.

At this point I'm bag holding until the 4th quarter. October, November, December with elections and potential vaccine news means a very good chance of another run up. If that fails or it looks like cruises are a lost cause I'll probably cut my losses and reinvest in tech like literally everyone else. My timeline for recovery is years and I'm fine holding that long if necessary, but I think that'll be the make or break point\n\nHowever I'm avoiding airlines like the plague because they go bankrupt even when the economy is doing well, and there's so much competition if one goes bankrupt they just get eaten by the others in a never ending cycle of shitty failing companies that are propped up by the government. And even if they go back to pre-Covid at best you'll double your money if you bought the bottom.

Historically bonds underform stocks and typically used to minimuze volatility.\n\nDividends alone should not be an indicator for buying shares or not and consider dividens are being taxed (if you want to reinvest that money anyway).', 'Where are you getting your information from? A lot of this is false and it seems you have a hatred for Bitcoin without knowing much about it, which is weird. Where did this come from? I’m genuinely curious. Did you lose money? I’m not trying to be snide, I’m just confounded by your attitude.\n\n&gt; First it was a currency, until it was adopted by nobody because of the cost to produce it and the cost/energy to confirm purchases.\n\nThis isn’t true. It was garnering interest from merchants *because* of its low cost compared to credit card and bank transactions. Just look it up. Costs for transactions only increased when the price was skyrocketing and there was too much demand. It’s well known that no current blockchain is scalable enough to handle mainstream adoption right now. This is still a nascent technology. Everything that you’re saying could’ve been said about the internet, and that’s exactly what Paul Krugman said about the internet, saying it was no better than a fax machine. And he was right. At the time. But time does not stand still. What he was wrong about was its potential.\n\nCrypto is not mainstream because it’s still being built. It’s like asking why no one is using a bridge that isn’t connected yet. It’s not ready for mainstream use, it’s not “open for business”.\n\nIf you were an expert on this technology and you were to say, “Hey, I’ve looked into this, and blockchain is a neat idea and great for small scale usage, but the obstacles in its path to be ready for mainstream usage are too big to tackle and I don’t see it ever being solved,” then that would’ve been a lot more reasonable than stating layman misconceptions and making it clear you haven’t delved deep into this at all.\n\n&gt; Oh yea and again, it\'s literally destroying the planet.\n\n[This isn’t true.](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/36596801/20150211_-_The_Relative_Sustainability_of_the_Bitcoin_Network_-_3rd_Edition.pdf?1423656218=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DOBSOLETE_An_Order_of_Magnitude_Estimate.pdf&amp;Expires=1596517425&amp;Signature=JLXXkdGbyiiNtIIDfOW545Ei6nftr~JKcJAsS3ZChSAfq6ehzWZEpLtR0WMoJI79n-sGE4OdyTlT8RUzjkXUtHurpjYFpVwTTWebljOo0iTTFGZlsqxSj7nkubPt4LNQntUnpNN~kMiN6NztA8Ah4~uKyAg6uOERnRPlXIWCEhjq6P1hKfLnh7tse2tj-WPPbU6dTqfXs2diU46smvnW4eUTlpHCeJoTPyFNSeugAtH9nbUgvCm5bu45oVwW1ZWUwEQ7fxI-x6dTei09O8ZYnTq8iYENA7410iMex~pIuejW8oYOKf0hbxqADrYS~Kl6cY~Yu1POPWUQ0bIbg4Ub0Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)\n\n&gt; Then it was a store of value (my favorite) until it spiked wildly.  Not sure how something so volatile can be a ""store"" of anything.\n\n&gt; Then it became an ""investment"".  No idea why.  Not sure how anything that caused people to lose 90% of their money can be considered an ""investment"".\n\nThis is the same thing, a store of value is an investment, like gold. And like gold, Bitcoin started off its life much more volatile than now, and its volatility is slowly decreasing. I can show you the metrics if you’d like. This is 100% to be expected. Without many market participants, price discovery is going to fluctuate wildly, the market is trying to find the optimal price people value it at. That takes a long-ass time. This is how markets and price discovery work. Look at penny stocks compared to value stocks for instance. Heck, this is even apparent when you look at a chart. The 1 minute, or god forbid the 1 second chart is crazy volatile compared to looking at weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly charts, which get less and less volatile because there’s time to gather more market participants...participating in price discovery. This is basic stuff.\n\nBitcoin is not a store of value yet on a day to day basis or year to year basis, this is where you’re going wrong. This is a long-term investment. If you look look at the big picture, Bitcoin is in a long term uptrend. The risk/reward is definitely there, and if it breaks the long-term uptrend, fine, get out of it. No one is saying to hold to zero.\n\nI agree that Bitcoin above, say $4,000 was a speculative bubble, much like Tesla just had, and many legitimate assets go through. Putting money into an asset going parabolic is not investing at all, it’s gambling. You’re hoping to get in and out quick. I sincerely doubt anyone got in near the high and held all the way to the bottom and then sold. That’s the only way anyone is losing 90% of their money, and I just don’t believe it. The layperson hearing the hype and getting in near the highs are weak hands that will sell as soon as they get in the red, that’s why the bubble popped. There weren’t enough people investing to buy and hold for the long term, they were just in it to make a quick buck. If gambling is your thing, then losing money is the name of the game.\n\nIf your point is to say Bitcoin is volatile, I agree, that’s the hype cycle of a permissionless tradable digital asset. That doesn’t prevent it from maintaining its long term uptrend however.\n\n&gt; One thing is for sure: any merchant who accepts it will immediately convert to fiat because of the risk of holding it.\n\nStill better than gold. You can’t go to a store and put a speck of gold on the counter to pay for a product at all, much less over the internet. Bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange is a use-case. Have you ever considered why you can’t pay for items with gold over the internet? It’s because of counterparty risk and regulation. A lack of trust. Bitcoin solves that.\n\n&gt; So I can confidently say it\'s failed to produce any legitimate solution to a real world problem that hasn\'t already been solved by current technology faster and easier.\n\nAs said above, Bitcoin is a trust machine. I can have a reasonable amount of trust that when I send a Bitcoin transaction with an adequate number of confirmations it’s going to be sent where I sent it, with no possible way it can get lost or censored in any way. The person receiving it can reasonably be sure that transaction is not going to be reversed, all without a middle-man, entirely peer to peer. Bitcoin is also the cheapest way to move large amounts of money from one entity to another.\n\nI don’t know why you say Bitcoin doesn’t solve anything. It solves a fundamental problem people have been wondering how to solve for decades before 2008. You believe all of the interest it has garnered so far in the academic community is all fake?\n\nMost importantly on top of all of that, as a store of value, it has no risk of being inflated by a central party or outside forces such as a huge gold deposit being found on Earth or in space. A store of value must contain certain characteristics, and Bitcoin fits the mold better than any other asset. This makes it the ideal protocol to build off of, so we can have a stable currency for the internet built on top of Bitcoin which everyone can trust. They can trust they can know what to expect, that there will be no foul play involved, fraud, or manipulation, that their value won’t unexpectedly go down without warning, etc.\n\nThis is the start of a new stable financial ecosystem.\n\n@ u/-OpportunityCost, u/TheRealTruru, u/Chewie_Defense, u/redmartian1', 'Your point is fair but the fact remains that the companies OP mentioned have preposterous amounts of money and power.

I mean it's not too hard to understand, trillions in transfer payments to the unemployed will only motivate them to STAY unemployed, especially when they are already so scared of catching covid. Furthermore, all this printing and extra money put into the economy will only devalue our currency, this is called inflation tax, it's where the fed prints puts more money into the economy thus having more money itself but your money now has a lesser purchasing power, so it's a very covert way of taxing people. As soon as people start to realize the true gravity of the situation, which a lot of people are hence the rapid rise in gold and silver, the value of dollar is gonna fall greatly, and my best guess is that we will move BACK to a gold backed currency which has already worked for us before. \n\nThe fed needs to cut its balance sheet, the government needs to downsize to get rid of its debt and the tax rate shouldn't be decreased like trump wants, that's only gonna increase debt. We should also INCREASE the interest rate so banks have more deposited money for loans which they can give to small businesses to expand to increase unemployment. \n\nAt this point, the bursting of the bubble just needs to happen, and only then will there be a chance to create a better economy.

In some instances a company will pay a premium because they want to knock a competitor out of the space or the competitor has something they want, or a company could be buying back its own stock.\n\nA purchasing agreement is nothing more than a contract to buy.\n\n&gt;Just trying to understand the market a little better.\n\nSince you have a lot of time on your hands I recommend reading some books.

Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the 17th century.\n\n\n&gt;This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future.\n\n\n&gt;The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.\n\n\n&gt;What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while.\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”\n\n\n&gt;Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\n\n\n&gt;Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?\n\n\n&gt;Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.\n\n\n&gt;A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.\n\n\n&gt;Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\n\n\n&gt;Terror over economic collapse drives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currency collapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard “cash is king” in late 2008, just when cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard “cash is trash” in the early 1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On those occasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort.\n\n\n&gt;My own preference – and you knew this was coming – is our third category: investment in productive assets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a minimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBM and our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies – think of our regulated utilities, for example – fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. To earn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior to nonproductive or currency-based assets.\n\n\n&gt;Whether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper (as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Cola or some See’s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume more food, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they produce for what others produce.\n\n\n&gt;Our country’s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens. Metaphorically, these commercial “cows” will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of “milk” to boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity to deliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as they did during the 20th century when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends as well). Berkshire’s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will be to own them in their entirety – but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts of marketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove to be the runaway winner among the three we’ve examined. More important, it will be by far the safest.\n\n\n--Berkshire Hathaway's 2011 Annual Letter to Shareholders"", 'Went through and sold half my TSLA shares today and bought more MSFT and got in on NET.

If you're looking to capitalize on laboratory testing, you might consider investing in the companies that manufacture the testing platforms and reagents instead of a clinical laboratory.

They manufacture multiple testing platforms utilizing various methodologies, but they also supply the proprietary reagents that run the various tests. Additionally, these analyzers require ongoing maintenance, parts, and technical support. All of these factors contribute to a steady cash flow for the company and ensures steady growth and development for years to come. \n\nContrast this with LabCorp; they are on the user end of this. They bring on these instruments and offer testing and simply pass the cost on to the patient. In my experience in the industry, LabCorp is a bit shady. They can bring down costs due to batching and automation, but it comes at a cost to sample integrity.. Your average hospital laboratory would be better run and managed, all of which is important in maintaining the laboratory's certification and accreditation. Should demand change, LabCorp would need to drop significant amounts of money to get in the game.\n\nIn the biotechnology and diagnostic laboratory world, PCR and other genetic platforms are the future. Companies that fill the role of developing PCR and genomic instruments and getting them in the marketplace are poised to do well, both now during the pandemic, and in the future with viral and bacterial panels.

It's valued at 1447 P/E right now (!) which is absolutely insane. I understand buying AMZN at 120-150 P/E but this seems way too out of whack. But hey, in the short term, maybe buyers will bid it back up and you can ride the wave, idk."", 'The market is following bubbles of the past and is the definition of castle in the sky. The market will correct itself and Tesla will plummet', 'TQQQ was created early in 2010, so we only have a little more than 10 years of historical data to evaluate its performance. Moreover, those 10 years has been more or less one long bull market. On the other hand, bear markets are utterly brutal for any triple leveraged ETF.\n\nTo illustrate this, I did a rough calculation where I multiplied the daily returns of the Nasdaq by 3 (lets call it Nasdaq3x), and ran the calculation from January 3rd, 1995 to August 6th, 2020. During this period, the Nasdaq moved from 743.5 to 11108. The Nasdaq3x went from 743.5 to 22176.5. So the Nasdaq3x performed better for sure, but would be well below March 10th, 2000 peak of 109270. For comparison, the bottom of this ""insane"" index would have occured on March 9th, 2009, when the index stood at a whooping 130 points. So sure you *MIGHT* get better returns this way, but the volatility would be crazy. And that is thanks to some extrodinarily good performance from the Nasdaq in recent years. It is by no means given that this will repeat itself in coming years.\n\nNow let us say that you bought the Nasdaq3x in January 1998 instead. This is still into the dotcom bubble, but still two years away from the peak. In this timeframe, the Nasdaq went from 1581 to 11108. The Nasdaq3x on the other hand would have gone from 1581 to just 6191. In this scenario, even after holding over 22 years, you would still be far behind the performance of the regular Nasdaq. Not to mention that you would still have to endure all that volatility.\n\nBoth these examples illustrates how hard triple leveraged ETFs get crushed in bear markets, and they are not guaranteed to outperform over long time horizons. Even in the first scenario, you would be roughly 80% down from all time high even though the Nasdaq3x outperformed the Nasdaq itself over the whole period. And in the second scenario, you would still need this current bull market to last for a while just to break even with the regular Nasdaq.\n\nEdit: corrected a typo', 'Elon is part of what makes Tesla a bubble.

Their popularity soared during the bull market. UBS, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., French bank Société Générale and Germany’s Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen Girozentrale all offered individual investors ways to tap into structured products.\n\nUBS created Mr. Mark’s ETN in 2012, as mortgage-investment firms recovered from the financial crisis.\n\nAt least 15 ETNs managed by UBS have been taken off the market this year after tumbling in value.\nOn the surface, ETNs don’t look much different than ordinary mutual or exchange-traded funds that track a group of companies. Both products allow investors to bet on the performance of anything from the U.S. stock market to the Swiss franc to wheat. But unlike ETFs, ETNs don’t own the assets they track. They are debt instruments. And the banks that issue them often have the option to take them off the market if their value falls below a certain level.\n\nOne reason ETNs have been hit hard in recent months as that many are leveraged, meaning they use borrowed money to amplify both gains, which also magnifies losses. Instead of rising 3% on a day that crude oil rises 3%, an oil ETN with three-times leverage aims to rise 9%. And instead of falling 3% on a down day, it would fall 9%.\n\nIt is “investing on steroids,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA, an investment-research firm.\n\nSome products layered complex strategies on top of each other. James Zhu, a 78-year-old retired college professor and engineer, invested his and his wife’s life savings into ETNs based on payment streams from mortgage bonds, bundled together by investment firms and amped up with leverage.\n\nSo-called mortgage real-estate investment trusts, or mortgage REITs, return a significant portion of their profits to investors through dividends. When interest rates are low, mortgage REITs can look attractive to investors because they offer relatively high income.\n\nJames Zhu and his wife, Angela, invested their life savings into ETNs.\n\nBy buying a leveraged ETN, Mr. Zhu was amplifying his bet on the mortgage market. Last year, shares of mortgage investment firms rallied. But this March, Mr. Zhu’s bet blew up.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic sent corporations scrambling for cash, increasing volatility in overnight borrowing markets on which mortgage REITs rely. That put pressure on their shares. ETNs making leveraged bets on mortgage investment firms nosedived.\n\nAn ETN's Demise\nLeveraged exchange-traded notes tumbled asthe coronavirus pandemic intensified. UBS'sETN tracking mortgage REITs fell so sharplythe bank pulled the note off the market.\nETRACS Monthly Pay 2XLeveragedMortgage REIT ETN\n\nThe ETN Mr. Zhu bought from UBS slumped to less than 25 cents a share, from around $14 at the start of the year. On March 17, UBS redeemed it, notifying investors they would be paid out $0.201 per security held. That resulted in a loss of $700,000 for Mr. Zhu, who had purchased the ETN at $13.35.\n\n“We’re too old to play those games,” Mr. Zhu said. “It’s too difficult for us. We were just looking for basic income.”\n\nHe is now suing his online brokerage, TD Ameritrade Inc., alleging the company made the ETN available to individual investors without providing sufficient disclosures. A representative for TD Ameritrade declined to comment.\n\nCleveland-based Brad Davis stumbled upon UBS’s leveraged mortgage REIT ETN while browsing commission-free trading app Robinhood. Like Mr. Zhu, he wound up being hit with heavy losses after UBS redeemed the note.\n\nUltimately, the 33-year-old doesn’t fault Robinhood for allowing him to trade the products. “I knew they were risky,” he said.\n\nAnother concept that backfired: ETNs focused on the $122 billion market for loans to small and midsize firms through so-called business development companies, or BDCs. Like mortgage investment firms, BDCs tend to offer investors hefty dividends to qualify for tax benefits.\n\nSo far this year, shares of two of the largest such companies, FS KKR Capital Corp. and Ares Capital Corp., are down about 39% and 19%, respectively. BDCs managed by BlackRock Inc., Carlyle Group Inc., and Investcorp have fallen 42%, 32%, and 38% over the same period. The S&amp;P 500 is down 5.4% by comparison.\n\nETNs run by Citigroup have suffered significant losses.\n\nNow, many worry that loan losses will mount as small and midsize businesses struggle during the downturn. A drop in the value of BDC holdings can increase its leverage level, possibly exceeding thresholds set with investors.\n\n“If you see the carnage you’re seeing in the larger businesses, that is going to be a real problem for BDCs,” said Dave Lafferty, chief markets strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.\n\nSome investors place little blame on Wall Street for their losses, saying they traded products they knew were akin to gambling at a casino—risky, difficult to time and even harder to profit from long-term.\n\nThe VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN was issued by Citigroup. Its prospectus says ETNs “may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day,” and noted it is “possible that you will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the long-term performance of the applicable Index is positive.”\n\nInvestors who sold the VelocityShares crude oil ETN at the end of last year could have come out positive, because nearly all markets, including commodities, rose on prospects at the time for global growth. The pandemic sent crude prices down sharply to $14 a barrel, from $61 a barrel at the end of 2019. The losses were amplified for holders of the VelocityShares ETN. It last traded at around 16 cents a share, down from about $15 at the start of the year. In April, Citigroup pulled the ETN off of the market altogether, adding in a statement that it would no longer issue notes of that variety.\n\n\n‘I don’t think it’s a good investment tool for most people,’ said Randall Simpson, who has traded ETNs on and off for five years.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a good investment tool for most people. It’s like a craps game,” said Randall Simpson, a 50-year-old project manager and environmental planner from Phoenix who has traded that ETN on and off for five years. Mr. Simpson said he has lost nearly 90% of his initial investment.\n\nYears of investing, though, had taught him never to put a substantial portion of his portfolio into ETNs, so his losses have been manageable, if painful, he said.\n\nSome investment professionals, including Messrs. Swedroe and Rosenbluth, contend that leveraged ETNs shouldn’t be as accessible as they are to individual investors.\n\nSome firms, including Vanguard Group, have stopped handling client purchases of leveraged or inverse notes altogether. Other online platforms catering to amateur investors continue to allow them to dabble in complex products."", ""The whole point is you have no idea what the top and bottom are.

It “generates higher cash flow than the stock market, behaves differently than other asset classes of stocks and bonds, and is one of the few areas of investing that are highly tax efficient for the individual investor,” said Douglas Abbey, a lecturer on real estate at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nMr. Abbey, who has decades of experience as a real estate investor, said his first rule was to buy property with a “forever time horizon” that will endure because it’s in a good location.\n\n“Like a good bottle of cabernet, you want real estate to get better in 20 years rather than turn to vinegar,” he added.\n\nHere is my advice to new investors\n\nGo slow and steady\n\nReal estate can be an excellent investment if done prudently and with some luck .

Meaning buy near Trader Joe's/Whole Foods or popular grocery store + Starbucks + gyms + restaurants + public transportation\n\nBe a responsive landlord. Have a handyman and plumber on call and a lockbox onsite so they have access to the property. Happy tenants don't leave. There is no need to have a property manager nowadays. You can take care of your tenants problems at a distance (out of town property) \n\nHere is a list of high cash-flow cities where property is usually cheap .

Near Starbucks is a seal of approval\n\nFlipping is another type of investing that is more along the get rich quick line of thinking\n\nBeware of (Buy Rehab, Rent, Refinance and Repeat) which is very popular in this subreddit.  Buy Rehab rent refinance assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans). Things can go wrong and you don't have a way to pay the hard money back. This is not for inexperienced investors unless you have your own money or another way to pay the loan if things don't go right .\n\nOthers recommend not putting more than 5% down when purchasing a property. Being heavily in debt is not a good idea when there is a crisis and you still have bills to pay but no income . It's better to have 20-40% per property.\n\nLastly HCOL markets rarely have properties that follow the 1% rule (monthly rent is 1% of purchase price) but have the possibility of appreciation. LCOL properties tend to have a much higher cash-flow but not so much appreciation."", 'Not all lobbying is inherently bad though.

It\'s certainly very important to have that edge and be able to offer a much more complete service, but I also don\'t know that this is a ""winner take all"" thing either - I think that telemedicine/remote monitoring will grow (and the longer the current crisis goes on, the more people are introduced to both as growth continues to get pulled forward) and I think there\'s certainly going to be room for more than one player.\n\nFrom the Q1 LVGO conference call: ""But Zane said it perfectly, and that is that it has become overnight both telehealth.

Dexcom and also, Abbott (https://www2.livongo.com/news/Livongo-Adds-Glucose-Data-from-Abbott-FreeStyle-Libre-Pro-System)\n\nAbbott is a much more diversified company but broadly, if you think that Livongo-style systems that monitor and take data and offer suggestions and other help based on that data are going to be more and more the norm, then it becomes a question of are there players where their devices are already generating data and now that data is going to be in more and more demand from other players?\n\nApple will probably develop more health monitoring over time. Masimo is another medical company that covers an element of patient monitoring. \n\nAnd I\'m not saying chase DXCM or things like that here, they\'re already up significantly YTD - it\'s more the idea of the food chain and if one thinks that there\'s going to be more and more remote monitoring and more and more feeding your healthcare data through algorithms to get a greater understanding and suggestions, then the data that other existing players already generate may become more and more valuable. There\'s so many other layers to this, too and I think monitoring can certainly help with medication adherence: ""As demonstrated in a 2019 study conducted by Express Scripts1, people actively using Livongo between 3 and 12 months had a range of 5.0 percent to 6.4 percent higher medication adherence, respectively, compared to matched controls. In addition, to date, Express Scripts clients using the Livongo for Diabetes solution experienced an average 24 percent reduction in medical costs after using the program for one year.""

When I talk about patterning, I'm referring to multiple exposures of a wafer to lithography, while EUV is the actual machine doing the lithography. They get to the same result (or are supposed to), but one gets there through improving the actual equipment while the other gets there through improving the technique of using the equipment.\n\n&gt;it was a sensible choice at the time. \n\nAbsolutely, and that's something I didn't put together for some reason. I mainly focused on the fact that they were expecting to be able to use 4 cores indefinitely, making high yields a luxury rather than a necessity. Thanks for pointing it out!\n\n&gt;As far as we know their 10nm yield issues have nothing to do with patterning.\n\nThis is incorrect; Intel themselves stated that patterning was the reason to for the delay in the Q1'18 earnings call. I simplified again here - I believe that it is specifically the SAQP process used on BEOL that is creating these problems for Intel's yield. SAQP used on FEOL is a mature technology - indeed TSMC N7 uses SAQP for FEOL. If you have a source for BEOL SAQP performing better than EUV in terms of yield I'd be very interested.\n\n&gt;The benefit that EUV has over SAQP is cost. Not defectivity. Not performance by and large. It's cost (and manufacturing throughput)\n\nI'm curious as to why you think this. It's pretty obvious from your comment that you understand SAQP has a higher number of steps in the lithographic process to actually finish the wafer. Generally, the more steps you have, and the more you mess with the wafer the more you get defects. That's a pretty fundamental law of semiconductor design.\n\n&gt;Intel is no different than Samsung or tsmc in that respect.\n\nAgreed, though I'm not so convinced on the evolutionary aspect. \n\n&gt;If history is any guide here, what we should expect is that Intel might be the 1st to roll out GAA.\n\nIf history was any guide, Intel should also have been leading the process race by a generation as it always did, instead of struggling."", ""Agreed, sometimes investors are just taking profits and that's all there is to it.

It “generates higher cash flow than the stock market, behaves differently than other asset classes of stocks and bonds, and is one of the few areas of investing that are highly tax efficient for the individual investor,” said Douglas Abbey, a lecturer on real estate at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nMr. Abbey, who has decades of experience as a real estate investor, said his first rule was to buy property with a “forever time horizon” that will endure because it’s in a good location.\n\n“Like a good bottle of cabernet, you want real estate to get better in 20 years rather than turn to vinegar,” he added."", 'Doom and gloom sells. That\'s why people keep harping on it. I read Bari Weiss\' [resignation letter](https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter) from the New York Times and it\'s definitely worth a read. While she does an excellent job describing the culture within the Times, she also is illustrating something far more sinister that is occurring within the media at large.\n\nIt really seems like the fringe voices are the ones that are bubbling to the top. If you make a post even in this sub which describes how you think tech stocks should go to zero (or insert some other number here that matches up with your ""ideal price target""), you\'ll probably go on to receive an award from this group, because so many folks want bad things to occur. It\'s the same group of people who constantly want to compare the US economy to Japan (""but what about Japan? Their market kept going down.""); Japan does not have retirement programs that attract hundreds of millions of dollars each week.\n\nIt\'s easy to look at something and just believe that ""one thing happened one time so therefore it will always happen all the time"". Some of the resentment in this sub seems to stem from envy. Whenever people mention Peloton, there\'s an inordinate amount of people who come out of the woodwork to talk about ""who can afford a $2600 bike?""\n\nInstead of taking this approach, it might make more sense to think, ""Okay, what can I do to be in a position where I can afford a bike like this?"" It\'s jarring that people would rather take the lazy route and attack those who can afford the bike instead of doing some self-introspection to figure out what they need to be doing differently to better their financial situation. Unfortunately, when the negative comments go on to receive upvotes, the people who post them feel validated in their response.\n\nOne rational explanation I can come up with for the constant doom and gloom is that we\'re all in different financial positions on Reddit. Looking at what receives recognition, perhaps the sub leans more towards people who are very early into their financial journey. It would then make sense that the things which are negative receive a higher tally of votes vs. the things that are positive. If you\'re in a position where you personally cannot invest; it\'s easy to blame external factors for your failures: ""Oh, my job was eliminated, but the CEO is still working there.

Like pre COVID we’d have fantastic jobs reports and partisan rags would jump at any opportunity to explain why they weren’t that great, or that there were other issues, or whatever.  And Reddit ate that up.  Like it got to the point where if I expressed some positive outlook for the economy people would just start arguing with me about Trump.  I really think a ton of commenters here cannot really grasp that an expression of economic positives is not an expression of political approval/disapproval. \n\nThat said it’s not unique to Reddit:\n\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5b75/304c7b0fd874bcce23c1386da4c11f1bc2a5.pdf?_ga=2.170332905.81161803.1597156505-1689834741.1597156505\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\tcausal factor in aggregate studies of politics in favor of economic perceptions. However, our results show that for macro-level analy- sis it is not safe to assume that economic perceptions stand outside the political and social arena. Economic perceptions are indeed the byproduct of judgments made by individuals with different partisan orientations, and these partisan perceptions do not cancel in the aggregate.\n\n&gt;As this study shows, the effect of partisanship in economic perceptions is important. It is almost universally accepted that the state of the economy is a primary determinant of presidential approval (Brody 1991; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Hibbs 1987; McAvoy 2006). However, the results from this analysis offer an important revision to our understanding of the way in which the public holds the president accountable for economic conditions. We show that, after controlling for the partisan component of consumer senti- ment, objective economic conditions produce no significant short-term effects on approval of the president’s handling of the economy. The influence of the economy on presidential evaluations is incremental.\n\n&gt;Although the focus of this study is on macropolitics viewed over time, the analyses have some implications for micro-level studies as well. By looking over time, we find that the effects of partisanship are stronger in some peri- ods (like under the George W. Bush Administration) and almost non-exist- ent in others (as was the case during the economic expansion of the Clinton Administration). Thus, even though partisan perceptions are the norm, condi- tions do exist in which the public overcomes its partisan biases, and economic perceptions and reality are in sync (Enns and McAvoy forthcoming; McAvoy and Enns 2010).', 'Chatime is the only publicly traded Taiwanese BBT tea stock  and only in the Taiwanese Stock Market. 2732.TWO', 'Yes you can bet on CFB and CBB on DraftKings.', 'Well the tech sector has been running of late.

Maybe, but again you don't know that.  Tech stock has always been pretty speculative in that you are investing in where/how you believe the tech will develop in the next 3-5 years.

Tech stocks are high but I'd say they are rightfully high because of this fact.\n\nMisinformation is indeed everywhere but that doesn't change the fact that the in the US publicly traded companies are required to be under scrutiny to insure accurate information is given to the public so they can choose what to buy.  If you take mis-information you get from a random person on you-tube or reddit as a fact that's your own problem.  The fact that mis-information is abundant doesn't change the fact that you can also get reliable and audited information about companies that are publicly traded. \n\nThese companies have to have their books essentially made public and they have agency's in place to audit and fine/de-list companies that don't report things accurately or act in other nefarious ways to manipulate stock prices.  The fact that Chinese companies being traded on the major US exchanges haven't had to follow these kinds of rules is absurdity, and if you actually want Chinese markets to be the next big place to invest I'd say that's foolish because of this exact reason.  When companies can report whatever numbers they want and the government does nothing about it it will just lead to massive instability with insider information running way way way more rampant than it is in the US.  If there is no punishment for manipulating stock prices companies will do it constantly, at least in the US there is the fear of massive fines and going to prison if you are caught.\n\nThere is a reason most of the world doesn't want to invest in Chinese markets with large sums of money.

A lot of people look at Bitcoin and think it can't have real value, it's just made-up internet money.  This either comes from a misunderstanding of how the protocol works (not knowing that there's a hard limit for how many can ever exist), or more likely, a belief that money is only real if it's created by a government.  \n\nThe part of Bitcoin that's hard to understand is how to actually use it.  A lot of Bitcoin advocates will say it's super simple to use, but it's actually far from it, for the average tech-illiterate person.  They need to figure out how to acquire Bitcoin (likely from an exchange, unless they want to mine and then it gets more complicated), how to create a wallet, important security features, etc.  The average person doesn't know how to do that.  And maybe they could figure it out with a little bit of research, but most money doesn't require research before being usable.  \n\nTo clarify, I'm very bullish about Bitcoin.  I think the underlying concept is great, it presents an elegant solution to double-spending, it has a lot of first-mover network effect built up, it has some promising second-layer solutions that will *eventually* make it easier for the average person to use.  But to compare it to the internet, I think Bitcoin is in the BBS days.  Although a lot of people have heard of it, it's current use is very niche.  Most people not only don't use it, they don't understand what is even useful about it.  What I think it will need for mainstream adaptation is something to act the way AOL did for the internet -- a mass-market gateway that makes it easy for people to use, even if they don't understand what they're doing."", 'I’ve tried but for some reason they say I can’t pay them in bubble gum.', ""For a beginner like myself, I stick more to index/etf funds, but am dabbling in individual dividend stocks as I am learning.

For example, in congressional testimony, one community activist, Gale Cincotta, made clear that “lenders will respond to the most conservative standards unless the GSEs are aggressive and convincing in their efforts to expand historically narrow underwriting.”\n\nUnder enormous pressure from these groups, the Clinton administration decided to expand federal government servicing of low-income and minority borrowers through various “affordable-housing goals.” Imposed in 1992, the different goals created a quota system requiring a certain percentage of the loans that the GSEs acquired each year to have been made to borrowers in financially isolated communities or those who were at or below the median income in the communities where they lived.\n\nThe initial low-to-moderate income quota for Fannie and Freddie was around 30 percent per year, a goal that was not too hard for them to meet. But the LMI goal was continually raised, to 40 percent in 1996, then 50 percent in 2001, and up to 56 percent in 2008. Impressively for a government agency, the GSEs hit their targets—by June 30, 2008, 57 percent of the 55 million mortgages in the financial system were non-traditional, meaning either subprime or otherwise of low quality.\n\nAs these goals were continuously raised, the GSEs found it harder and harder to find creditworthy borrowers. So in response, Fannie and Freddie had to reduce their underwriting standards. In other words, they dove deep into the subprime mortgage market. This involved either reducing the accepted credit score, lowering the required down payment, raising the debt-to-income ratio, or accepting low or no documentation. As early as 1995, for example, the GSEs were buying mortgages with 3 percent down, and by 2000, they were accepting loans with zero down payment. By 2006, 45 percent of first-time homebuyers were putting nothing down.\n\nFannie and Freddie, with their implicit government guarantee, were able to borrow at artificially low rates and become increasingly leveraged, dominating the home mortgage market. This drove underwriting standards lower and lower throughout the entire market. In order to compete, private lenders had to follow the GSEs underwriting standards. Indeed, as Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer at JP Morgan, explained, “the ultimate goal [was] pushing private sector banks to adopt the same standards” as Fannie and Freddie. To be sure, the private sector made many poor decisions in going along with Fannie and Freddie, but it was the GSEs that lured many to make irresponsible loans through their secondary market operations.\n\nThe result of the government’s expansion into the subprime mortgage market was that by the time of the financial crisis, more than half of all mortgages in the United States were subprime or otherwise low-quality mortgages, and the various federal government agencies were directly backing 76 percent of them. The federal government, through the GSEs, drove the subprime bubble. Columnist David Frum summarized the American housing system well for the National Post in 2008:\n\n“The shapers of the American mortgage finance system hoped to achieve the security of government ownership, the integrity of local banking and the ingenuity of Wall Street. Instead, they got the ingenuity of government, the security of local banking and the integrity of Wall Street.', ""The time to take profits was about a month ago when the sector rotation started.

How much the stock is expected to move, IV, how long until the option expires, and the price of the underlying stock. The later being the least interesting as it simply is what it is. \n\nThis makes intuitive sense. If I know for sure a stock will be the same price at expiry I am not going to pay anything at all for an option. If I think it might move a lot, setting a price is more valuable. Likewise I would pay more to set a price far in the future than I would tomorrow. These things also work together. A stock is likely to move less in a week than it would in a month. \n\nWith stocks like Tesla where you have a lot of price movement, people are willing to pay more options than they are more stable stocks. Effectively this means you can get a larger premium when you sell an option. Once you sell, you rely on that second variable, time to expiry. As expiry gets closer, the option will naturally decline in value aside from changes due to the change in the underlying stock price. As long as the option stays out of the money, meaning that exercising the option would not yield a profit, the option will expire as worthless. Even if it is exercised, you only lose money if the differences is in excess of your premium. But since we got a larger premium, we have more room to play with. \n\nSo, for an example, I could sell a put expiring on Sept 04 at a strike of 1300 for $54.35 a share at close today. Since options contracts are for 100 shares, that means I make $5435.00 for each contract. So long as Tesla closes about 1300 on Sept 04 the option will expire as worthless and I will simply pocket the premium. If it closes lower than that I still make money so long as it is about about 1245. \n\nThe risk, and it's a big one, is that it drops well below that. Let's say the extreme bears are right and Tesla is a huge bubble. If it pops and drops to 100 a share, I still have to buy it at $1200. That's going to cost me $120,000 and I could only recoup $10,000 so I'd be out $110,000. \n\nThere is a strategy called the wheel where you do the above until you do have to buy the shares. Then you sell calls to make premium. If those get exercised and you are forced to sell the shares, you go back to puts. \n\nThe problem with doing that with Tesla is that the high share price makes contracts super expensive. Most people can't afford to take six figure bets. So with the split the price will be lower, but IV shouldn't change much. That makes the per contract price much lower and more in line with what us normal traders are willing to do."", ""Not necessarily.

America\'s immigrants from Europe were, historically, the religious extremists/cultists who came seeking freedom from persecution, debtors and criminals fleeing prosecution or charges, and the early cultures they founded were rampant with abuse and violence, like slavery and the outlaw Wild West. In other words, America\'s white culture was that created by Europe\'s crackpots, religious nuts and failures who were obsessed with avoiding authority and social control, and their descendants are still that way.\n\nIt\'s a fact that Asian IQs are higher than European IQs and that American IQs are lower than European IQs. I personally don\'t think that differences in ethnic IQs are related to genetics but I believe that they are related to culture. And American culture is trashy and intellectually incoherent. Americans even haven\'t mastered the skill of feeding themselves, as our 40% and rising obesity rates show. \n\nIn addition to every other crackpot theory that drives American culture, we have the cult of American Exceptionalism where Americans think we\'re the best people and coolest nation in the world. We\'re not. There was a period of about 100 years where a combination of expanding into an undeveloped, relatively unpopulated continent with abundant natural resources, combined with developing 20th century technology gave us a lot of prosperity. But our easily accessible oil has been tapped, our undeveloped land has been populated, and there are no more free rides off abundant natural resources for us. As of the last 2 decades of the 20th century, America has turned increasingly to economically exploiting its working classes to enrich a small minority of privileged people at the top with financial and Wall Street bubble-creating scams, police and public official oppression and divisive hatreds and partisan politics. We\'re about 1-2 decades from turning into a democratic version of Soviet Russia.\n\nThe stock market bubble we are in, is a bubble of psychological exuberance that arises from the mistaken belief that we are innately superior to other nations. The attacks on China are a racist, prejudiced reaction, a knee jerk reaction to being completely owned and outclassed by an Asian country that we viewed as a source of cheap goods produced in sweat shops because of our racist view of Asian economies. In reality, Chinese business are grounded on good fundamental value and efficiency, not just lower wages. The growth that keeps lifting US stocks is the optimism created by Chinese economic growth in 2020. \n\nEvery bubble has an irrational belief that supports its irrational exuberance. This stock market bubble\'s irrational belief is the belief in American exceptionalism, a delusion which was effectively exposed when Texas oil wells began to run dry a couple of decades ago and we experienced our first energy shocks. This bubble will burst when people realize that we can\'t follow in China\'s recovery footsteps, not without being more oppressive to our lower classes and economically suppressing blacks and browns more than we have been doing so far this millennium.

Places like China combat this by not letting people choose what career path they go down and harvesting organs :) Works pretty well actually but has obvious human rights trade-offs.\n\nThe problem in the U.S. is that prices are being held above the market equilibrium price by pharmaceutical companies and Doctor\'s unions (American Medical Association). It\'s easier to understand how the AMA does this, so I\'ll explain that way. The AMA restricts the number of medical schools that are able to open in the U.S. (In name of ""quality control""). This controls the number of new graduates coming in each year and is also why it\'s so hard to get into medical school (and why it\'s so expensive). They try and keep this number equivalent to the number of doctors leaving each year. By decreasing the number of doctors available, they decrease the number of patients that are able to receive the medical procedures they provide. Thus, only the patients willing to pay the most are able to get the procedure.\n\nThe politicians in the U.S. that want to make healthcare prices affordable are the same politicians who are either very fond of labor unions or (like my ex) are in bed with them financially.\n\nPharmaceutical companies take advantage of the inelastic demand for their goods (and lack of competition) to increase the price of the drugs by decreasing the amount they produce. They lack competition largely in part thanks to the patent system. But we can\'t get rid of the patent system for medicine because then companies just wouldn\'t have a reason to discover new medical treatments and society would be worse off. We also have a hard time enacting legislation that increases competition with out-of-patent goods in the pharmaceutical industry because of their massive lobbying budget.\n\nChina is the only country with low healthcare prices and low wait times (for those who have a decent social score). But their trade-off is human rights. So ultimately, the tradeoffs for healthcare are prices vs wait-times vs human rights.\n\nWant to decrease the prices? Increase wait times or decrease labor rights. I personally support going after the AMA. But anyone in my political party would not agree because they love labor unions. I love my labor union, they keep my wages high. But I don\'t like your labor union, because they keep my prices high.\n\nHence the deadlock we are in :)', ""So fund it another way or cut some of the bullshit we spend money on.\n\nFFS, we spend like $700BB a year on the DoD alone.

The fed can raise rates, sell treasury securities and bump up reserve requirements if it becomes necessary."", 'The Fed going into negative interest rate territory would be quite historic as it’s never happened before, although we’ve seen nations like Japan, Switzerland, and other Euro area countries do this in order to spur business. However, we have to remember that the US Dollar is viewed as the global reserve currency, so for the US to go into negative interest rates, what would that mean for the rest of the world that heavily depends on the strength/stability of the dollar for trade? It seems the Fed is more open to the idea of stimulus packages and bailouts while keeping the interest rate slammed to the ground, but not below it. That way they can still encourage consumerism and keep the machine going by offering forgivable loans and pandemic relief packages. Consequently, to the astute investor, this will shy away many from having confidence in the greenback as investors will continue to rush to gold for a stable safe haven, hence the recent surge +$2000 gold prices. This will correlatively strengthen “anti-dollar” currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and potentially as of recent development, Bitcoin — which is mirroring gold more and more as it continues to stabilize at around the $10k level, earning the title “digital gold”. Which btw, is more of a fixed asset than gold itself (more on that later). We also have to look at oil and how increasingly lower demands and high supply is creating an oil glut which is destabilizing many petrocurrency dependent nations... like Russia for example whose economy/GDP numbers are very dependent on the price of oil, their main export. Cleaner energy, electric future is the trend. Look at what’s happening in Dubai, a once luxurious playground for the rich is slowly becoming an abandoned wasteland as a lot of the wealthy implants are leaving as the petro-funded oasis wakes up broke. The rest of the Middle East has a similar fate and not far behind. OPEC has their work cut out for them, similar to the Fed where they have to save face in a world where they are both becoming increasingly irrelevant, when there are technologically smarter, more efficient alternatives, ie: Renewable Energy, Electric Vehicles, DeFi/Blockchain. So, in microeconomic terms we’re experiencing zero interest rates, UBI-like unemployment services, people rushing to refinance mortgages with the banks betting that real estate market values will continue to exponentially rise, in perpetuity — which if you consider inflationary housing bubbles... that’s another rabbit hole. Ultimately, from a macroeconomic perspective, it’s simply the end of a cycle and the start of another, which is why I attached that video link by hedge fund legend Ray Dalio explaining the economic machine — appreciate you watching it.

Pointing to something like book value for Bed Bath as a reason for buying and not really doing an analysis of the issues with the business itself would have not been a good result. There\'s been countless attempts to position Macy\'s as a value (""look at the p/e!"", ""look at the real estate!"") Anyone who has followed these into Macy\'s over the last few years and not considered the declining relevance and other issues with the business itself have gotten obliterated.  There was a thread where people were all excited about Michael Burry buying a large stake in Tailored Brands about a year or so ago and I went into a laundry list of why I didn\'t like it. It declared bankruptcy the other day. The situation with covid didn\'t help, but Burry\'s plans didn\'t include any attempt to really revitalize a mismanaged business with declining relevance - he was basically hoping for a short squeeze and then to exit. Most famously, look at the saga of Sears, where Bruce Berkowitz and others sold that value story to anyone who would listen and wound up losing a fortune as he held Sears to 61 cents and a huge chunk of Sears Canada to 0. That was more than a decade spent on a value thesis that deteriorated - especially post-2008 - with each passing day. Literally - the Berkowitz thesis was the real estate and the stores were falling apart (https://www.businessinsider.com/sears-stores-are-falling-apart-employees-say-2017-6, Collapsing ceilings and no working toilets: Sears workers describe decay in failing stores)\n\nRetailers were certainly not helped by Covid, but none of these retailers were in good shape before this. The current situation basically pulled forward what would have otherwise been a more drawn out decline.\n\nNothing wrong with value, but I think people looking at things solely through the lens of valuation and going, ""p/e = cheap"" and not doing an analysis of the business itself (or on here, a focus on the dividend yield above everything else - years of threads about Ford as the stock continued an orderly decline for half a decade from the teens to the single digits and a suspended dividend) have resulted in people finding themselves stuck with one value trap after another in recent years. People see a low p/e, go ""cheap!"" and then are confused when the market doesn\'t agree and cheap gets cheaper and cheaper - I think compelling value stories are really few-and-far-between and so much that is considered ""cheap"" can be classified as ""cheap for a reason"" or more often ""cheap for a lot of reasons."" \n\n""Only sticking to low PE companies may result in lower overall gains because of the big stories missed, like amazon, however I think that a greater risk to the average investor is from this \'growth\' train mixed with poor active management.""\n\nI think there\'s two extremes. There are growth chasers who pile in to Ark-style investments and think that trees grow to the moon. There is a degree of complacency that sets in when growth stocks basically go up every day (and when the complacency does set in - ""why not add a little more? it only goes up"" and as I\'ve often said, these ""escalator up"" periods often suddenly change to ""elevator down"" and growth investors get shaken out.) There have been a number of rotations over the years on here that have been more significant than the few brief ones that have been seen this year and towards the end of each, there\'s always threads about ""how can I diversify away from tech?"" There will absolutely be another one of these and rinse/repeat, people will gradually  go back into growth. There\'s a lot of storytelling in investing and growth tells the good stories. Value managers have a very bad run and the fund closes. Growth managers have a bad period and they can still count on CNBC to call them in and talk up ""the next big thing.""\n\nOn the flip side, there\'s the value investor and I think the issue that I have is that I have one idea value idea here and there on occasion that sort of checks off all the boxes. ""Value with a potential near-to-mid term catalyst"" is great. ""It looks cheap and I\'ve heard of it""  not so much. There\'s been all manner of things that have been brought up over the years on here that are ""down a lot"" and therefore a ""value"" - I think real, compelling value stories are few-and-far-between. There\'s also a ""value investor pride"" that seems to be the reason for not wanting to invest in anything above a certain p/e (and then for ""value investors"" they often display a lot of frustration towards the performance of growth stocks they were proud of rejecting) and that\'s just something I don\'t understand. Be a flexible investor; people on here are individual investors for the most part. You don\'t run a large cap value fund and therefore are only limited to value. If value isn\'t working, look around and be flexible. ""Value will work again someday!"" = statement I\'ve heard every year for the last several.  The flip side is true too - if you\'re a growth investor, look around for compelling values (although again, I think compelling value stories are much more limited in number and often smaller situations that are not names often discussed.)\n\n""there is a greater risk that the fundamentals will never catch up to the valuation leaving the investor worse off.""\n\nI think with anything people have to be discriminating; being an indiscriminate growth or value investor will ultimately lead to problems. There will be value plays that wind up as value traps, there will be growth plays that turn out to be fads (and people can do very well with fads if they can exit well and not start to confuse a fad for something more than that) or never catch up to valuation. I think people have to continually look at what they own and re-assess. Listen to other people\'s opinions - read the thoughts of other investors who do not agree with you. A lot of times you might not agree. Sometimes other people will change your mind and keep you from losing money. Sometimes they may just allow you to see/think about an aspect of a company differently. Sometimes you may simply not agree, but I think people have to really be open and continually do the homework to understand the business they own and the dynamics of that industry.', ""You should look more into investing in the European market.  US has historically performed better, but it's also trading at double the earnings compared to many of the European indices, and EU is much further along in fighting COVID.  Some investment firms are also pushing the European outlook much higher, after being down on European stocks for years.  US market as a whole is a much larger bubble at this point than any market in Europe."", ""I disagree.  You can't time it perfectly, but you can recognize that we are in a massive bubble.  Every single time in history that it has been this overpriced, it's lost at least 49%.  I'd take those odds, worst that happens is you miss a few gains."", ""Maybe it will just keep growing. Just becuase it's in a bubble doesn't mean it *has* to burst. Tesla could just keep riding the hype train for years."", '""A big century old beast is most likely going to be easier to value than that of a hot newcomer whose trajectory is indeterminable but potentially huge.""\n\nThe issue imo becomes more trying to analyze whether the century old beast has management that has effectively kept up with the industry and remains a dynamic, relevant company. If it has not, then trying to point to a low p/e often results in a value trap. Certainly not a ""century old co"" but I remember a while back when Gamestop had a p/e in the low single digits, a high yield and a stock price in the teens and people were acting like I was crazy for not being interested. It\'s now losing money every quarter, the yield is long gone and the stock price in the single digits. When Immelt left GE after more than a decade of mismanagement and the spell was broken as people really took a closer look at the company, the stock started to head towards the low $20\'s and upper teens. If you thought that ""it\'s GE, it\'s gotta bounce, right?"" No. 16 years of mismanagement is not going to be turned around overnight. Around $20, there was a discussion that BBBY was trading below book. When it was in the low single digits recently it was also trading below book. \n\nPointing to something like book value for Bed Bath as a reason for buying and not really doing an analysis of the issues with the business itself would have not been a good result. There\'s been countless attempts to position Macy\'s as a value (""look at the p/e!"", ""look at the real estate!"") Anyone who has followed these into Macy\'s over the last few years and not considered the declining relevance and other issues with the business itself have gotten obliterated.  There was a thread where people were all excited about Michael Burry buying a large stake in Tailored Brands about a year or so ago and I went into a laundry list of why I didn\'t like it. It declared bankruptcy the other day. The situation with covid didn\'t help, but Burry\'s plans didn\'t include any attempt to really revitalize a mismanaged business with declining relevance - he was basically hoping for a short squeeze and then to exit. Most famously, look at the saga of Sears, where Bruce Berkowitz and others sold that value story to anyone who would listen and wound up losing a fortune as he held Sears to 61 cents and a huge chunk of Sears Canada to 0. Berkowitz\n\nNothing wrong with value, but I think people looking at things solely through the lens of valuation and going, ""p/e = cheap"" and not doing an analysis of the business itself (or on here, a focus on the dividend yield above everything else - years of threads about Ford as the stock continued an orderly decline for half a decade from the teens to the single digits and a suspended dividend) have resulted in people finding themselves stuck with one value trap after another in recent years. People see a low p/e, go ""cheap!"" and then are confused when the market doesn\'t agree and cheap gets cheaper and cheaper - I think compelling value stories are really few-and-far-between and so much that is considered ""cheap"" can be classified as ""cheap for a reason."" \n\n""Only sticking to low PE companies may result in lower overall gains because of the big stories missed, like amazon, however I think that a greater risk to the average investor is from this \'growth\' train mixed with poor active management.""\n\nI think there\'s two extremes. There are growth chasers who pile in to Ark-style investments and think that trees grow to the moon. There is a degree of complacency that sets in when growth stocks basically go up every day (and when the complacency does set in - ""why not add a little more? it only goes up"" and as I\'ve often said, these ""escalator up"" periods often suddenly change to ""elevator down"" and growth investors get shaken out.) There have been a number of rotations over the years on here that have been more significant than the few brief ones that have been seen this year and towards the end of each, there\'s always threads about ""how can I diversify away from tech?"" \n\nOn the flip side, there\'s the ""value investor"" and I think the issue that I have is that I have one idea value idea here and there on occasion that sort of checks off all the boxes. People', ""I'd use their 1Y Revenue Growth percentage which is a bit of above 10%. Not too shabby, but SQ just posted over 40% YoY growth.

It's easily my top non-career favorite hobby."", '&gt;I stand by my opinion that the term has misleading connotations.\n\nOkay, this is precisely where we disagree. You having identified this can probably help us bridge our disagreement. The phrase is initially confounding, but not misleading; there\'s some baked in contempt for how unfair and ridiculous it is. But that touches upon a contrasting quality of socialism that Karl Marx and many of his advocates talked about. Maybe you\'ll get the earmark of why it\'s used so much if it\'s explained like this:\n\nSocialization occurs from a centralization of capital from a set of solitary ownerships (e.g. individual control), to a social ownership (e.g. mass control) and collective endeavor. There are two major forms of social ownership; a full society-wide public ownership, and a  cooperative ownership. ^[1](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4405875) \n\n&gt;""Yet having stated this as the common definition of socialism, one must necessarily admit that there are a wide variety of views among socialists of various stripes as to just what constitutes social ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange.""\n\nTherein lies a distinction, in that with a society-wide system, the surplus is controlled and distributed to all members of the socialist collective. In a cooperative ownership, the surplus is controlled and distributed to all the members of a specific enterprise — which can still be inclusive to some, but also be exclusive to others. ^[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/048661349202400302)\n\n&gt;""[...] internal market exchanges cease when all of industry is brought into the ownership of a single entity, whether the state or some other organization [...]; the discussion applies equally to any form of social or community ownership, where the owning entity is conceived as a single organization or administration.""\n\nIn the phrase ""socialism for the rich"", the administration is a particular class of people, who are contrived worker-members of an enterprise (as being one of the capacities for bringing about a socialist framework); the means of production and the surplus of the economy is redistributed — the two ways in which socialization aims to regulate the market — but to the wealthy. The root criticism highlighted by the phrase is in its characterization of the wealthy class as a socialized enterprise of individuals, which is conveyed with the suffix-like indication of ""for the rich"".\n\nAnyway, that\'s true about UBI. Maybe we\'ve seen the same research; I\'ve read a lot involving ""modern monetary theory"". One interesting study claimed that UBI could grow the U.S. economy a whopping $2.5 trillion over eight years. I volunteered for Bernie Sanders\' campaign since 2015 (so the redistribution of wealth isn\'t a foreign idea to me), and double-dipped as a canvasser for Andrew Yang\'s campaign in 2019 (so you can imagine where I sit on all of this). It\'s no doubt that I believe in the premise of UBI, and these stimulus checks are probably moving the Overton window for a lot of people. ""Negative income tax"", as you mentioned, isn\'t something I\'m against. Partially funding a basic income through value-added taxes into positions of the supply chain that wouldn\'t be strained from it is another idea. Recycling the surplus of the economy into the basic income might also be doable?\n\nWe both have a similar stance on the bases socialism. I\'m a self-described democratic socialist, and what some people don\'t understand is that this has a favorable view of capitalism. There\'s no way that I\'d want a Marxist-Leninist state, and a system that\'s controlled by one political party. Authoritarianism has always rubbed me the wrong way.', ""Recently in NYTimes:\n\nEconomists and investment experts said real estate investment played an important role in any diversified portfolio. It “generates higher cash flow than the stock market, behaves differently than other asset classes of stocks and bonds, and is one of the few areas of investing that are highly tax efficient for the individual investor,” said Douglas Abbey, a lecturer on real estate at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nMr. Abbey, who has decades of experience as a real estate investor, said his first rule was to buy property with a “forever time horizon” that will endure because it’s in a good location.\n\n“Like a good bottle of cabernet, you want real estate to get better in 20 years rather than turn to vinegar,” he added.\n\nHere is my advice to new investors\n\nGo slow and steady\n\nReal estate can be an excellent investment if done prudently and with some luck . It can pay for your kid's education or for whatever fancies you and is still there for your retirement. Unlike stocks .\nKeep in mind that 33% of Americans rent their home .\n\nThere are 2 ways to invest : 1) buy and hold which produces income or 2) flipping which if done right can grow your investment quickly .\n\nLocation, location location!  Meaning buy near Trader Joe's/Whole Foods or popular grocery store + Starbucks + gyms + restaurants + public transportation\n\nBe a responsive landlord. Have a handyman and plumber on call and a lockbox onsite so they have access to the property. Happy tenants don't leave. There is no need to have a property manager nowadays. You can take care of your tenants problems at a distance (out of town property) \n\nHere is a list of high cash-flow cities where property is usually cheap . In order of highest cash-flow\n\nFlint MI + Detroit MI + Youngstown OH + Gary IN + Muncie IN + Hammond IN + Reading PA+ Buffalo NY +  Canton OH + Cleveland OH + Dayton OH + Lansing MI +  Pittsburgh PA + Warner Robins GA + Deerfield Beach FL + South Bend IN + Akron OH + Largo FL + Evansville IN + Tamarac FL + Rochester NY + San Tan Valley AZ + Kokomo IN + Daytona FL + Waldorf MD\n\n\nThe GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier) values/ratios indicate how expensive is a city in relationship annual rent/ property price. These 35 cities in order from lower GRM (property price ) to higher but all under 15. Best to invest or cities to live where property is more affordable.\n\nDetroit MI+ Cleveland OH + Memphis TN + Toledo OH + Buffalo NY + Pittsburgh PA + Chorpus Christi TX + Milwaukee WI + Baltimore MD + Lubbock TX + El Paso TX + Indianapolis IN + San Antonio TX + Fort Wayne IN + Columbus OH + Kansas City MO + Laredo TX + Arlington TX + Fort Worth TX + Philadelphia PA + Wichita KS + Tulsa OK + Houston TX + Omaha NE + Jacksonville FL + St Louis MO + St Petersburg FL + Tucson AZ + Oklahoma City OK + Greensboro NC + Dallas TX + Charlotte NC + Louisville KY + Orlando FL + Cincinnati OH\n\n\nCheck quality of schools+ crime + sexual offenders and if near grocery store and restaurants even better . Near Starbucks is a seal of approval\n\nFlipping is another type of investing that is more along the get rich quick line of thinking\n\nBeware of (Buy Rehab, Rent, Refinance and Repeat) which is very popular in this subreddit.  Buy Rehab rent refinance assumes that you can find a property ($60k) that after remodeling ($40K) you have added enough value ($150K) to it that when you refinance it ($120K) you will get most, if not all of your capital back to pay back the purchase and remodel. These properties are usually in disrepair and banks don't lend so the purchase and  the remodeling are usually done with hard money (short-term high-interest private loans). Things can go wrong and you don't have a way to pay the hard money back. This is not for inexperienced investors unless you have your own money or another way to pay the loan if things don't go right .\n\nOthers recommend not putting more than 5% down when purchasing a property. Being heavily in debt is not a good idea when there is a crisis and you still have bills to pay but no income . It's better to have 20-40% per property.\n\nLastly HCOL markets rarely have properties that follow the 1% rule (monthly rent is 1% of purchase price) but have the possibility of appreciation. LCOL properties tend to have a much higher cash-flow but not so much appreciation."", ""I thought so too good news is revenue has been increasing year after year at a large rate (in 2015-2016 revenue jumped 265%) and jumia has received a lot of awards for being a bright start up from MIT in 2017 as well as receiving awards from other institutions.

To clarify my point, I\'m more opposing the matter of fact way that you stated your investment will continue growing based on past performance. \n\nAdditionally, on your last point, if I can back up a bit to explain where I\'m coming from. Let\'s paint a hypothetical picture of a ""perfect portfolio"" in a fictional stock market where 3 companies exist. Let\'s pretend like we\'re in the midst of a pandemic similar to COVID.\n\nCompany 1 is a small back-end video tech company. Company 2 is a long standing beverage/soft drink company. Company 3 is a once large airline now downsized. \n\nNext, let\'s say that some Warren Buffet-memory clone-machine learning AI has created the ""perfect portfolio"" based primarily on RISK ASSESSMENT with the following portfolio mix: 50% investment in Company 1, 30% in Company 2, and 20% in Company 3. Noteably, Buffetron lives in the cloud and nobody knows his portfolio mix.\n\nNext, we have an investor with a plan: put 80% of his portfolio in Company 3 because they appear heavily undervalued, and additionally he thinks Company 1 is in a bubble.\n\nNow, it is completely possible that Company 3 outperforms Company 1 and 2. After all, Buffetron only developed the perfect portfolio based on risk metrics and existing data; it can\'t read the future. But most likely, Company 1 and 2 will outperform long-term based on the best data available.\n\nAlso, similar to our world, the largest institutional investors in this scenario are invested in a portfolio much closer to the ""perfect portfolio."" After all, they have access to better data, tools, and (as unfortunate as it is) the most insider information. \n\nAs a result, because institutional investors make up about 70% of the stock market, the overall volume of investment in the three companies reflects a mix closer to the perfect portfolio.\n\nEssentially, what I\'m getting at is that unless the retail investor truly believes he has found information supporting his position that VERY FEW if any institutional investors have already found, he needs to understand that he is taking a risky position. I\'m not even saying he SHOULD NOT make the investment. Maybe he has a super high risk tolerance and wants to flip a quick buck. But I would urge this investor to take caution and heavily research the insolvency, systematic, and concentration risk (key terms here) before making the investment.\n\nAlso, I know you haven\'t said anything along the lines of putting all your eggs in the leisure basket, but I want to emphasize the importance of diversifying a portfolio based on risk. \n\nFor example, right now my portfolio is based heavily in tech, bio/pharma, and food/groceries. Most of those are in ETFs. Then, I have some silver and crypto to hedge against the weakening US dollar, and I have been considering investing a small amount in leisure companies with strong balance sheets, but I\'m treading lightly.\n\nHope this is helpful, and appreciate any differing opinions.', ""Giving the perspective of someone who works in tech: Google is childish, unstable, and completely uninnovative.

Zero debt.\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? - The reason i want to invest is because I want the flexibility/option to withdraw this money at any point in case of bigger financial emergency. That said, my primary goal is long-term. It would be awesome if I could multiply my savings by 1.5x or 2x and legitimately retire in the next 15-20 years.

So don’t compare Tesla bubble rn witb bitcoin bubble back in 2017', '&gt;Just Robinhood crushing trading fees and its ease of fractional shares and DRIP investing put all the other platforms on skates trying to keep up.\n\nNot really.  Keep in mind that Robinhood created a niche for customers who didn\'t exist.  A **lot** of people didn\'t invest because of the $2,500 account minimums and $5 per-trade commissions.  (I remember in 1998-1999 when Schwab was $29.99 per trade)\n\nSo those people would not have been at another broker.  They traded crypto.\n\nMost investors who are not undercapitalized don\'t give a shit about fractional shares.  We buy in blocks of 100 shares to take advantage of NBBO and to make options plays easier.  (NBBO does not apply to odd-lot order sizes per SEC Rule 611)\n\nSo Robinhood might be piquing the interest of brokers to offer some new products, but they\'re not ""disrupting the market"" and taking business away from guys who move $10,000 a week in and out of their positions.\n\n&gt;I liken them to what Dyson did to vacuum cleaners: innovation and design so appealing that competitors just straight copy them.\n\nOh, Dyson.

Back in late march, silver was the obvious choice because of a decline in price, and concerns about stagflation resulting from supply chain disruptions, increased production costs, shutdown orders, and massive QE/fiscal stimulus. Real estate was bad because of defaults on rent payments and eviction protections/impact to commercial real estate markets. Equities were bad because of huge declines in earnings due to shutdowns. Bonds were bad because they had near-0 yields.\n\nBut with silver/gold prices having skyrocketed, equity values at record highs despite high unemployment, and bond yields being near zero, how do you protect against inflation without risking buying into a bubble?\n\nIt seems like the fed has injected a lot of liquidity into the system, but that capital is flowing into capital markets rather than consumers, as seen by the rapid rise in M1/M2 money supply, and the decline in M1V (velocity of money).\n\nThis raises new questions about valuations. Yes, equities are expensive relative to forward earnings compared to February. But with limited areas for capital to go, does that justify current equity valuations? If you avoid the stock market due to excess valuations, what are you using to protect against inflation?"", 'Same thing with Bitcoin.

Today, Germany is still a technological and industrial leader that even the CIA constantly conducts technological thefts.\n\nJapan was betting its entire economy on export and manufacturing, while it didn’t invest at making its citizens becoming wise investors and technological geniuses - not just a handful of Nobel laureates rather than a population of like-minded, innovative people. Japanese bureaucracy is the one most blamed for the bubble collapse, which the West doesn’t ever has such model of bureaucracy. As Princes of the Yen stated perfectly, Japan was a Stalinist regime that became highly efficient at industrial-export production at the costs of citizenry incomes to compensate for high saving rate. Paul Krugman also wrote the “Myth of Asian Tigers” around the period of Japanese bubble collapse. He also agreed with the following ideas and even expanded much further than I can described.

Gold/Silver increased dramatically in value, but then crashed to just as low as it did before once it became apparent that severe inflation wasn't going to happen.\n\nWith gold/silver, it's all about timing the market. Once prices vastly exceed their underlying industrial value, it becomes more about anticipating the market. Personally, after $SLV rose from my starting price of $11.70 to $27.30, I got out. Will it rise more? Probably, but I can't guarantee I'll get out before it comes crashing down. At $12(near record lows), SLV seemed like a risk free hedge against inflation.

Unfortunately, this means that politics DO have a strong influence on markets.\n* Foreign exchange markets do not do a great job of offsetting massive credit expansion, especially in the short term. This is especially true when the borrowing is done on-shore. \n* Behaviorally, people will almost always justify an asset bubble in a wide variety of ways.

They get the fees for adding liquidity and then pay to remove etc.  Make-or-take fees.\n\n&gt;I\'ve also heard that MM\'s do technically trade, but it\'s done at the institutional level &amp; they get paid the spread.\n\nYes, this is market making.  There\'s an incentive because the exchanges want market makers to create liquid to give the investor better pricing.  This is why exchange pricing sucks horribly as the spreads are wide as shit.  But it prevents a big liquid player from turning the market.  Instead, the market maker closes the gap on that spread which allows us to trade and get better pricing.\n\nA lot of guys have asked if they can trade *without* going through a market maker, but that would be shitty because pricing would be significantly worse.\n\n&gt;But say the ask on an underlying their firm was actively trading was 14.00 and the bid was 13.92 and they bought/sold 10,000 shares, that MM would get paid a commission or fee of $800 for that specific underlying provided they hit their guaranteed min fill for their eligible orders.\n\nYes this is being paid to add liquidity by putting in order in the market.\n\n&gt;I was told they keep the information very low key until you move up to the higher levels of operations within a firm.

It's like every bubble in that sense.\n\nAnd similar to other bubbles, if people begin to lose confidence and suspect that TSLA could drop then you'll often see a massive sell off.\n\nIMO it's quite likely TSLA will hit $2k, split, then drop off a cliff as optimism to go any higher dries up. But who knows. Bubbles can grow for an extremely long time."", ""But it's not a bet. It's already a reality. As of last year, Tesla chips were at least half a decade ahead of NVIDIA chips.

Real estate and financial securities have skyrocketed for the past fifty years. At the same time, services for the wealthy have also skyrocketed ie. college. Wages have remained the same. To the back drop of technological deflation, productivity gains from tech are being fed right back into assets funneled by money printing by the Fed. Money printing leads to direct asset appreciation. That's literally what feudalism is. Free markets be damned. In the case of tech, this is leading to real changes. \n\nIt isn't a bubble. Apple is the size of the East India Company. It's actively colonizing more digital spaces/real spaces. So is Microsoft. So is Amazon. And Facebook. And Google. And now Tesla.

If you tried to use them in Japan you probably would have gotten out of the market a decade before the peak.\n\nThis assumes there is only one asset to invest in.\n\nAs an investor you're doing something wrong if you're not selling out of positions where you don't see value, or significant downside risk. I understand sometimes crazy stuff can happen and then in hindsight you might realise you should have stayed in a bit longer, but that isn't a strategy. The right move in the case of the Japanese asset bubble was international diversification, not staying investing in a bubble.\n\nBut presumably this was posted because of the ATHs we're currently seeing in the US market. In this case, if you don't see value there are plenty of other US stocks that are still way off their highs. People still investing in TSLA or the QQQs are playing a very risk game.

Hydro-electric needs consistent wave/water currents).

At the same time, fears of inflation due to significant increase in capital or balance sheet, just simply won’t realize itself.\n\nTake for example, in the post 2009 financial crisis period, US “printed” 17% of GDP, China at 35%, and Japan, stunning 70% of GDP and yet, in terms of inflation, japan sees disappointingly low inflation and that’s on top of government policies trying to promote 2% inflation. It seems that the flow of capital in japan, often just circles back right back into cash saving accounts bypassing the actual economy, and thus, no matter the amount, does not generate actual economic activity.\n\nThis is why japan is an oddity.

There were no iPhones or anything when the dot-com bubble happened. Bookstores and Blockbuster was still a real thing in 2000. Additionally, the vast majority of households did not have access to the internet in 2000.\n\nThe world is permanently altered and will continue to be going forward. Many people have developed habits surrounding their ""new normal"". Look at the spending folks are doing on their homes. People are really starting to enjoy their spaces and are building comfort things into their place so that they can live there for an extended period of time.\n\nAt my organization, pre-covid, we spent tens of millions of dollars on travel. This has all been nixed in favor of WFH as the ""new normal"". We\'re more productive than ever and folks are generally happier. As Brian Cornell (Target CEO) said earlier this week during his blowout quarter, *""We’re not on planes. We’re not spending dollars on lodging, so many of those dollars have been redirected into retail""*\n\nWhile the media often likes to point out that there are 20M+ unemployed people, there are still millions of Americans who are employed right now and have very little to spend their money on (outside of home improvement and outdoor recreational projects). We\'re starting to see these working folks continue to put money into various sectors. As mentioned before, home building is up, healthcare is up, e-commerce is up, online dating is up, [camping world](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-Holdings-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) is way up (outdoor rec!), etc. Any skill set or trade which services these areas benefit from the increased demand picture. Unfortunately, these good stories don\'t usually hit the mainstream news channels as they\'re too positive, I\'d imagine.\n\nIf you do decide to go forward with your hedge, I wish you luck!

A publicly traded company conducts an IPO to issue a specified volume of stock to the market at an offering price to raise capital equivalent (hopefully) to what they value the company. \n\nThe day to day market we interact with involves shares, post-IPO, being bought and sold between investors. One who owns the stock may ask for a certain price to part with their stock (the ASK), while the potential buyer is only willing to pay a certain price for that stock (the BID). \n\nSimilar to how a dealer offers a car for MSRP and you say “No way, I’ll offer X under asking”. If the dealer accepts, that’s the instantaneous market price for the car. \n\nNow back to stock, the market price is the last transaction for the price per share of that stock. If investors think that stock is undervalued for its current or future business offerings, they may be willing to offer more than the next guy to buy that stock. This is the demand you mentioned, folks willing to compete to buy shares by offering more. Alternatively, there may be folks that really value the stock and aren’t willing to go lower to make the sale, so it may not be volume of potential buyers but the resistance of sellers to part ways with their company’s shares. Would you sell a car for less than you think it’s worth?\n\nOn the flip side, stock prices go down as owners of shares are willing to part with the stock for lower prices than the last transaction. Back to the car analogy: imagine you find out the car you own is a POS and you want to just get rid of it. You may keep lowering the price until someone buys it; could be a bargain hunter or someone that thinks the car at Y value is a good deal. There may be millions that think Y is a good deal, so volume of interest is high, but they aren’t going to pay more than Y price. \n\nHope this helps, I’m just a hobby investor so I’m sure there are far smarter people than me here.', 'Same.

The people that bought the assets prior to the bubble bursting didn\'t think it was a bubble, they thought it was fairly valued (clearly). They thought that the downside risk outweighed the upside reward. The people that bought the Nikkei 255 through the 1980s were all correct, until they weren\'t.\n\nPE basis is just noise.

Why would they want to cannibalize their bread and butter?  They are too heavily invested in their current infrastructure to support the production of gas vehicles.  EV will be only be a side project or a hobby for the big auto makers for awhile.   Unfortunately for them, this will allow Tesla to continue to build up their lead in EV and battery production.

Trading at nearly 33x forward earnings with Azure growth now under 50% means that they will likely need to identify a new leg of growth to keep commanding such a premium valuation. Azure has been the main driver of the margin and EPS expansion story the past 3-4 years, so as it matures to AWS type growth (30s %), it will be tough for MSFT to keep up the same level of relative outperformance as we have seen. \n\nI would also say it’s a wait-and-see as far as the TikTok acquisition (or not). Nadella did a great job overseeing the LinkedIn integration and allowing the site to maintain autonomy and therefore brand strength. TikTok at a $50bn valuation could be a high risk-high reward play. Yes, it’s currently the platform of choice for Gen Z. But even still, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger all have higher DAUs. And Instagram is seeming to get some folks to try out the copycat Reels feature. If they can hijack users from TikTok as they did with Snapchat, it’s hard to see TikTok as a highly monetized business in the future. It could still work, but I think tracking Instagram Reels is key. \n\nGaming grew over 60% last quarter, and I do like the focus on a subscription gaming model.

Complaints about ""too expensive!"" and then eventually ""WHY IS IT STILL GOING UP?"" then eventually, acceptance.

The first anything, dollar, million, billion, trillion etc. is the hardest because of exponential growth. To get from one million to two million you need to double your money (100% growth) but to get from two million to three million you just need to grow 50% to get the same absolute amount again.\n\nWhere the $100,000 number in particular comes in I suspect is where exponential growth and investing really starts to make a difference in practical terms for most people. If you have $10,000 invested in stocks you\'ll return about $1,000 per year on average, and the 4% safe withdrawal rate enables you to take $30 a month out of the account. That\'s nice to have, but it probably won\'t impact your living standard much.\n\nNow, once you reach $100,000, that 10% is returning you $10,000 per year, a substantial fraction of a middle-class salary. The 4% withdrawal now gets you $333 per month in income, which is rather substantial for most people even if it\'s not enough to live on. You could e.g. pursue quite a few hobbies or sports that involve classes, private instruction, or memberships with that much money without even needing to touch your ""day job"" salary. That\'s a noticeable upgrade in living standards, and that doesn\'t start to come into play until you get into that $100,000 range.\n\nThe original quote comes from Charlie Munger about 20 years ago, and in purchasing power $300,000 now would be more like it. That gives you $30,000 in returns in an average year and $1000 per month at a 4% withdrawal rate. Very significant in much the same way as above. Interestingly, at this level of assets invested, in a good year where the markets return 20-30% your portfolio would return $60,000-90,000, which eclipses what many middle-income people earn at their day jobs.\n\nYou are very correct in your second point. Saving and investing is ultimately a far better way to make money than being an employee in the overwhelming majority of cases, but the middle class mindset and worldview sees working as an employee as the way to be a virtuous person that contributes to society. That mindset also encourages conformity and mediocrity, and the middle class tend to derive large parts of their identity from subordinating themselves to bureaucratic institutions. All of this discourages middle class people from pursuing ""financial independence"" or ""early retirement"" even when they\'re fortunate enough to have the financial means and basic inclination, and also discourages them from pursuing another excellent way to succeed in life, entrepreneurship and business ownership.\n\nValuing saving, investing, business ownership, and entrepreneurship as the way to be a virtuous person that contributes to society is much more of an ""owning class"", upper class, or aristocratic mindset that is quite alien to middle class culture. This mindset, in contrast to that held by the middle class, values pursuit of what some have called active leisure as the purpose of one\'s life, leaving a legacy to your descendants and your culture and civilization, and patronizing or even participating in the arts and sciences. These pursuits across life tend to be independent and characterized by more personal (as opposed to bureaucratic or institutional) relationships than the middle class are habituated to or are even comfortable with.\n\nFinancial education would certainly help people understand their finances better, though I doubt a required course would do anything other than waste time teaching those who wouldn\'t retain the information anyway because they\'re not interested in it, but the real issue is not so much the lack of financial education so much as the value system they are using as a guide to their lifestyle.

I’m completely baffled why this has encountered such a vitriolic response when it was a simple opinion question. Again, if you don’t have anything constructive to say then why even waste your time responding? I didn’t pretend to be a master of investing nor did I ask a dumb question. The fact that I suggested something you may not see as wise has nothing with pretending I know better.  And nowhere in my post did I express frustration with slow gains (see: reading comprehension). I see more potential short term gains with the latter. I must be talking to a seasoned 30 year investment veteran here. Oh wait, you used the word “yoloed”. Never mind. Main point - I think you should invest in something that would help you with those reading comprehension skills (I bet they have books).

Both subs are two parts of the same coin and there is a lot to learn from the advice and mistakes found within both, especially if your goal is to live a life without debt or financial constraints (yes, I said it, neither sub always has the best approach!). Being very technically minded, I find learning the ins and outs of the stock market (and crypto/nano) to be very rewarding. Developing passive income through these forms of investments is not only a dream I’ve had for years so that I have more freedom and ability to walk away from jobs/circumstances that don’t serve me without being trapped by the financial requirements of daily life, but also because it’s easy money waiting there for those of us who are willing to take on the learning curve and make some, whether it be calculated or balls-to-the-wall, risks. \n\nI am willing to make conservative investments, such as long term investing in dividend stocks and ETFs, putting them aside to grow over time even though in the short term they appear lackluster at best. \n\nI am willing to make controlled risks; for instance, investing quite a lot in Tesla and Amazon in recent months (during and since the dip mid-March), two companies I see as being incapable of pulling what Cisco did in the late 90s because of their lack of any real significant competition in the US market place and their sheer size, but also because they both, in their own ways, have leaders who are relentless visionaries and can see where our world is heading and predict the consumer needs of the future. Additionally, deciding not to sell Tesla and Apple currently because of the upcoming 5:1 stock splits, even though someone might look at my portfolio and see the profits, asking me why I wouldn’t take the money and run. \n\nI am also willing to make higher level risks like investing in start ups that I see a future for but who have no competition at the time of going public. Also, the even riskier realm, imo, of crypto/nano such as investing in bitcoin back when it first spiked to $3K-$4K in mid 2017, against the advice of the nay-sayers within the general public, and investing in other altcoins that, even with deep research, if I’m honest, are 100% risks (I literally keep the mindset that I will never see that money again, whenever I invest in new altcoins. I have been wrong and have profited, but I have also had some moderate losses). \n\nI am still learning and have never dabbled in options trading. I may have it wrong, but to me that is next-level and I am simply not ready for that. I can see how once one learns the ins and outs of that form of trading, the rewards can be very plentiful. \n\nSome of the best advice I get from the various financial subs on reddit are to not make financial risks if you are unable to lose that money in it’s entirety if they fail, to diversify your investments, and if you can’t purchase something twice, then you can’t afford to purchase it once. I haven’t always followed these rules in the past, and at times not following those rules lead to huge gains, but they’ve become my golden rules as I’ve become more well versed within these investment realms.\n\n**It should be noted, I don’t come from money.

How do you explain a stock like Tesla which is up 800% in the past year and over 500% since March? \n\nFrom my perspective this entire stock market recovery seems extremely dependent on tech stocks, pushing them to insane valuations not unlike the Dot Com bubble.

This is when people who did their research and the first to profit on the bubble bursting, started to take notice and buy swathes of shorts for collateralized debt obligations.\n\nIn a nutshell (it\'s quite more complex), real estate bubbles happen because banks are borrowing money from other banks and so on and so forth and interest rates get so low/high (this is related to something called a [bond rating](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/fixed-income-bonds/bond-ratings) as the more borrwing the banks due; The more risk the creditor takes on; which lowers the bond rating) due to competition that the first bank can\'t do it no more so they raise their interest rate which causes every bank to raise theirs and it happens over the period of just a couple hours. This goes on until a rate that nobody / nor bank can pay which causes mass foreclosures. (Hence, the ""bubble"")\n\nThe same exact thing is happening right now. The Real Estate Index\'s have grown exponentially in the past three or so years. This could just be due to a healthy economy but the problem is our economy is not healthy. It\'s very very far from it. Which, is making everyone think that people have already made their move in shorting CDO\'s.\n\nNow, you ask how is it more volatile.

The triggering effect was a big ripple from a cascade of events that were for one reason or another bound to happen.\n\n**3) You can\'t predict when the bubble will burst.**\n\n\\- Just not happening. It comes down to your level of risk tolerance, how you diversify your portfolio so that when it does it, that portfolio will recover just as most people did in March.\n\n**4) Wall Street is not Main Street.**\n\n\\- Though I primarily subscribe to Mohamed El-Erian, to quote/paraphrase Bill Ackman, ""Wall Street may be hitting all-time highs. However, if you create an index for Main Street, it is down 80%.""\n\nAccording to the SBA, 99.7% of the US comprise of small businesses.

Even those living paycheck to paycheck, they can get creative, and the quarantine itself creates more ways to save on expenses. I\'m sure a lot of people are also working with their landlords to weather through the pandemic. Smart landlords know that even if they are unhappy with it, 1) They\'re not likely to be able to find new tenants during this time 2) Even if they really wanted to evict, that process may be a serious PITA because of the pandemic.\n\nIt\'s only been 6 months. If those reserves and creativity are to dry up, we\'ll see it in the next 6 months. The past 6 is not a good indicator of anything at all.\n\n1b) Small Businesses, PPP, or responsible ma &amp; pa stores or what have you probably tried their best to take care of their businesses and employees the past 6 months mitigating the larger effects of unemployment. Sure, the economy is ""opening up"", but retail consumers have not come back. The new equilibrium has changed and the cascading effects has yet to be seen.\n\n1c) Only after busineses go through a full finacial cycle or exhaust their reserves will you see mass layoffs, in turn means people can\'t pay, which in turn means other businesses will receive less revenue because of lack of spending, and the spiral continues.\n\nTHIS is the real macroeconomic effect. This happens at scale and takes time. 6 months is absolutely nothing at the macro scale.\n\nThink about it, at the macroeconomic scale it doesn\'t matter if a few businesses are thriving. If the rest of the economy is failing, people have no money to spend on the big businesses. This is a huge ticking time bomb you will not see on the stock market \\*now\\* but it will be felt later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) The Stock Market is being propped up by more than the Fed**\n\n2a) One hugely significant thing people are not talking about is toward the end of 2019 all major brokerages eliminated the commission fees for stock trading. This HUGELY increased money velocity on the stock market because there\'s no perceived costs or barrier to entry to trade. When you rapidly trade stocks between people the slightest positive outlook will lead to much more rapid growth, even if you assume only existing participants are trading.\n\nBut that\'s not all, retail investors exploded BECAUSE it costs nothing to trade. They may had been hesitant and sat in the sidelines in the past, but where value-investors are hoarding cash? These formerly sidelined retail investors/non-investors are pouring in, their cash contribution easily rivals what cash previously taken out.\n\n2b) The Stimulus packages are being thrown into the stock market rather than the economy.\n\nThe stimulus packages came in too early for most people who had no fear of their job security (yet) and had not felt the squeeze in their usual spending. It was not selective enough so many middle class and those in hi-tech just wound up with money they didn\'t know what to do with. With extra cash on hand they bid the stock market because that\'s what everyon\'es doing, right?\n\nThis is latently harmful to the macroeconomy, because bidding up stock prices doesn\'t inherently produce value, its actually spending them on the economy that does.\n\n2c) Rise of retail investors\n\nWith no where to go, people who normally have budget for travel or casinos, or other forms of social activities/make-up etc. that don\'t make sense in the social distancing era they move their money into \\*drumroll\\* stock market, rather than purchase alternative consumer goods.\n\nAgain, like 2b with the stimulus checks, this inflates the stock price but does not produce economic value.

It is almost impossible to time the market under any circumstances, but over the last decade or two the price of securities have become increasingly detached from real world performance, economic indicators and reality in general. This makes it even harder to get a pulse on the market.\n2) Purchasing equity positions in established companies from one another is not value added investing. You are not putting capital at risk in hopes of wild returns when the business you helped fund innovates in their respective market. You are purchasing fractions of those original equity positions in hopes of a stable returns.\n3) Returns come primarily from two sources: a) sharing profits with shareholders (dividends) and b) an increasing share price.\n4) Reason dictates that a highly profitable company should yield better returns than an unprofitable company, however this is not always the case. Early investors want an exit strategy which often comes in the form of an IPO. Many companies in an ""innovation"" field IPO well before they are profitable so secondary investors can also speculate. While an IPO can represent a capitalizing round for these companies, those shares are still bought buy institutions and those with big bank relationships meaning that the vast majority of trading that occurs immediately after an IPO is of this non-value-add return seeking type predicated on the idea that you are ""speculating"" and seeking higher returns by buying into riskier businesses with a promising future.\nConclusion:  Share prices are determined by what the market thinks they are worth. When people use the stock market as a means to speculate, rather than a means to park capital for a decent return bubbles happen quickly as share prices cease to reflect what a company is worth, but rather what people think a company might be worth in the future.

I think this is a very bifurcated recovery of winners and losers and I think the longer this goes on, the more you\'re going to potentially see changing consumer behaviors/habits become ingrained and will be a tailwind for certain industries/themes (e-comm, telehealth, digital payments, etc.) Retail giants and restaurant chains gain share unfortunately while mom and pops/Main Street loses. There have been some discussions by the chains of great real estate becoming available and you have to imagine that a lot of that is mom/pop places going away.\n\n  Money hasn\'t been put under the mattress nearly to the degree that I thought it would during this; I think it was astonishing that earlier this year Williams Sonoma (which certainly is not something that is recession-friendly) had positive comps during a quarter where their stores were closed for more than half the quarter. People are buying RVs right and left. Money that would have been spent on apparel and other things is being spent on home.

VNO and SLG remain near the lows and it will be interesting to see if those recover - if a couple of years have gone by and those haven\'t gone anywhere, I think that\'ll be very concerning.\n\nThings like RH, Home Depot, Lowes and even something like Scott\'s Miracle Gro benefit as people continue to move and emphasize their home. Depending on how the current crisis plays out, perhaps people continue to look at their home differently and some of the emphasis on spending to create home comfort continues on and there\'s less spending elsewhere.  Lowes noted in the earnings PR that some of their remarkable growth in the last quarter is coming from ""wallet share shift away from other discretionary spending."" And that\'s certainly the case: I think what you\'re seeing in retail winners (Home Depot and Lowes with 20-30%+ comps, which is remarkable) is because that money isn\'t being spent elsewhere (apparel, etc.) People aren\'t spending on A and B, so C is getting the spending emphasis. While I think some restaurant chains that are prepared for digital are doing well, I\'ll guess a lot of people are continuing to eat at home (perhaps part of the Buffett reasoning for the Kroger position?)\n\nIf this becomes a more home-focused population for a while even after this is over, then home entertainment continues to win. Video games, Netflix, Roku, Peloton/Lululemon\'s Mirror instead of going to fitness class, etc. Out of the house entertainment (particularly movie theaters; you\'ve already seen the deal with Universal and AMC to shorten the theatrical window) loses. E-commerce wins (and anything that powers businesses selling online) /convenience wins (Target\'s Drive-Up Pick Up had 734% growth last quarter and they\'re expanding the service sooner than thought.) Any retailer that was already in decline before this has seen that decline accelerate and additionally, I think you already were seeing consolidation of shopping before this crisis. Now if people are going to go get something, they really probably want to get everything in one place. Problem for specialty retail/department stores. I think the outdoor shopping center with need-based anchors is going to be an okay business going forward. I think the indoor mall where Gap and Macy\'s are anchors is going to be a terrible business going forward and a lot of malls are going to have to be repurposed.\n\nTech and other growth that is less impacted or benefits from this has seen basically a stampede into it. A quote from a Bloomberg article a couple of weeks ago: ""Going by this logic, the market, consciously or otherwise, is doing more than just adjusting for a brutal but brief economic interruption. Rather, it’s repricing itself for a more profoundly altered reality -- a world in which the urge to limit human interaction squeezes the old economy mercilessly while hastening the ascent of a digital and mostly automated new one."" (https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/nasdaq-valuations-say-you-ll-be-stuck-at-home-for-a-long-time)\n\nI think there\'s been a lot of pulling forward of growth for many tech companies and many of them have said as much, many of them I think have tailwinds from this. That said, when you have growth funds up 60-70% YTD and it\'s August, is some degree of that already well reflected? I think so and that\'s why I trimmed (sold some, kept rest) a number of aggressive growth names a couple weeks or so ago. Additionally, whereas SaaS anything has been a winner this year, this quarter you\'re starting to see some cracks form and a bit of separation between winners and losers. Atlassian, for example: ""Fiscal 2021 will be a challenging year. We will lean into the headwinds we face as a business, and be bold as we push through the turbulence."" So I think in enterprise tech spending you\'re probably going to see people have to be more choosy and figure out what is more mission critical. \n\nI think there\'s going to be businesses that are going through some bumps during this that will be more relevant in the years to come. Ecolab is an example; that company discussed on the Q1 conference call about how hand sanitizer in lobbies of buildings or stores really started after H1N1 - before that, it didn\'t exist. Post-corona, how many more places are going to have sanitizer and additional sanitation/hygiene practices that they didn\'t previously? Solid, consistent business for years and I think probably going to be a solid, consistent business for years to come.\n\nRates are low and companies that can smartly use that to their advantage are going to benefit.\n\nSo I think what has interested me during this (and I think I\'ve thought more about my investments during this than I have in the last few years) is really the winners and losers (and whether some losers are going to be to some degree permanently impaired - will some % of business travel not come back and be virtual?), habits that will potentially change to some degree for good (the rise of telehealth/remote monitoring, etc) and more.\n\nI\'m not saying that things are great by any means. Things are fragile. But post March low you\'ve basically seen a stampede into much of the new economy while the old economy names have lagged (and yesterday Exxon gets booted from the Dow while Salesforce is in) and while there are people on here who seem to want to believe everything is bad, some companies have done quite well/benefited throughout this. I think looking long-term,  many of those companies will continue to. The question for me short-term is whether we\'re near a point where everyone is on one side of the boat (growth.) Again, things also remain fragile. We\'ve seen multiple rotations lasting a few days this year and it would really surprise me if there\'s not a more significant one at some point. If there was a solution to the current crisis tomorrow, you\'d see a considerable rotation.\n\nI did trim a lot of high growth (particularly SaaS) a couple of weeks or so ago but a lot of that has already been re-deployed, just into different growth themes and names that are somewhat slower/slower growth after buying a lot of/putting more emphasis on high growth in March/early April. I have a long-term view and I don\'t intend to not be invested/be heavily in cash, but given how well this year has gone investing-wise, I thought it prudent to dial down the aggressive growth after dialing it up in March/April.\n\nSo, not bearish, but I do think that some aggressive growth is overextended.  The problem becomes a lot of the ""impacted"" sectors don\'t look all that appealing, either. I\'ve called out medical devices as something of interest - a SYK isn\'t as appealing as it was when I discussed it towards the lows, but it\'s still down for the year and I think that\'s a business where demand has been really simply delayed. A lot of elective procedures have been cancelled/delayed because of what\'s going on but eventually old people will get knee replacements. There\'s certainly others, too - and that\'s not saying that this sector will bounce back tomorrow by any means, but unlike some other sectors that are impacted, these are needs that have been delayed, not wants.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Monitoring what companies are saying. What are consumer companies saying about spending? What are software companies saying about their customers and desire to spend? etc.\n\n2.  The longer this crisis goes on, what are the long-term impacts even post-crisis? What habits are going to change to some degree permanently - and in that case, who wins, who loses? Will the losers see some % of their business not come back?\n\nSo those are the two things I\'m focused on really. What are companies saying and the longer this goes on, how much to consumer habits/behaviors change to some degree permanently/for a very long time after this is over?', 'So you would think. But perhaps it is smart bet on the company that lives and dies by excelling at a niche vs the monolith that dabbles with niches', '# Today is Tuesday, the 25th of August\n\n\n\n## Upcoming events for Tuesday, August 25th\n\n - Stock splits:\n\n    - GBLEF @ **1:10**\n    - WTCRF @ **1:3**\n\n - Expected earnings:\n\n  ACH, ADSK, AMWD, ATHM, AZRX, BBAR, BBY, BMO, BNS, CRM, EH, ELMD, FINV, FRO, HAIN, HEI, HMY, HPE, HRL, IDXG, INTU, ITRN, JILL, MDT, NOVN, NVUS, OOMA, PINC, PLCE, PSEC, PSTG, RGS, SCSC, SJM, TOL, URBN, UTSI, VEEV, YJ\n\n - Ex-div:\n\n  ACCO, DHT, NMRK, PRSP, RBA, SLF, SPGI, YUM\n\n - Economic events and announcements:\n\n    - 2-Year Note Auction (previous: 0.155%)\n    - API Weekly Crude Oil Stock (previous: -4.264M)\n    - CB Consumer Confidence (consensus: 93.0, previous: 92.6)\n    - FOMC Member Daly Speaks\n    - House Price Index (previous: -0.3%)\n    - House Price Index (previous: 287.3)\n    - House Price Index (previous: 4.9%)\n    - New Home Sales (consensus: 1.3%, previous: 13.8%)\n    - New Home Sales (consensus: 785K, previous: 776K)\n    - Redbook (previous: -2.8%)\n    - Redbook (previous: 2.8%)\n    - Richmond Manufacturing Index (previous: 10)\n    - Richmond Manufacturing Shipments (previous: 23)\n    - Richmond Services Index (previous: -14)\n    - S&amp;P/CS HPI Composite - 20 n.s.a.

No one can give you anything close to a sure-fire strategy for financial advice especially during these times; even the most seasoned investors have only seen a couple financial crises in their lifetime, and this particiular crisis is unique in many ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best we can do is to ensure we fully understand the context of the situation we\'re in. What I would offer in addition to what I\'ve already said in the post you replied to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Look at historical YOY growth. The S&amp;P for example, the accepted historical average is 10%. Plot that onto a graph chart and look at that trend line. We REALLY shot up sharply in the past couple years [close to 30%](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/dow-futures-last-trading-day-of-2019.html). From the same article if you look at the deep red bars they coincided with economic crises; the 1975 oil crisis/recession, 1982 inflation/recession, the 2000-2002 dotcom burst, the 2008-2009 financial crisis/great recession. By all accounts and historical data we should be in a recession right now. But immediately after March 23 \'20 the stock market got immediately propped up. You can keep propping that bubble up, but eventually it will burst, and with nearly 100 years of stock market data we fully expect it to correct back to the trendline.\n\n2) I personally have moved my 401k out of the stock market and into cash-equivalents as of a couple months ago. Do I regret it? Ya, a bit, many of the plans I was on has grown 10-20% within the past few months. I still don\'t trust this kind of hypergrowth, and coming back in now would be unwise based on my own risk tolerance because it feels like I\'m buying at the highs while expecting it to crash and sustain a value well below current values. I have a couple stock picks that I deeply regretted with my own ""spare money"" which I personally succumbed to FOMO but it turns out I bought them at the peak and really should have stayed in tech rather than bet on volatility.\n\n3) Prior to February I never, ever actively managed my 401k or stock account. I was actually doing really well (I worked in hi-tech and had company stock). I did the smart decision of selling all my stocks in late Feb fully anticipating the pandemic issue to explode globally because no one\'s taking it seriously. What I regretted was that I didn\'t have a re-entrance plan, I just stayed out, and returned at a peak in April and missed out on a lot of gains since March 23.\n\nHad I simply kept my original portfolio, which was tech-centric, (I had a lot of Apple, Zoom, Square, etc.) my portfolio easily would have doubled even WITHOUT timing the dip. (That sentence alone should also be a redflag just how inflated the current bubble is).\n\nHindsight is 2020, but some hindsight can be turned into experience for the future because some information actually ARE available beforehand. What I learned from my mistake was that I could have anticipated the difference between the current economic crisis fromt he past; that online and hi-tech will largely be unaffected and the March 23 drop was just irrational fear across the board.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my takeaway for you is, if you are currently on a portfolio which you established before the pandemic, just stick to it, you\'ll likely turn out ok. At the very worst, any losses you incur would just be from the blown up bubble that no one\'s really entitled to anyway. Don\'t let greed take hold of you. At the end of the day, if you stick with your old portfolio, even should it crash, it will just wipe out the balloon portion but you\'ll be back to where you deserved to be pre-pandemic whether that comes out to a net of 10% up or 10% down, ultimately not too bad. If you\'re one of those people who already doubled their money from the pandemic investments, my advice to you would be cash out and GTFO. Take your winnings and don\'t succumb to greed. \n\nMy best actively-managed investments were ones where I had a plan on how much profit I would be happy with, and stick to the plan and sell when i met my goals. My FOMO stocks where I deviated from that plan all tanked below my original investments. If you\'re going to active manage, make sure you have a plan. Stick to it, becuase chances are, you were a lot more rational when formulating that plan than you would be with glowing greedy eyes when you see the stock keep going up.\n\nIf you\'ve had been actively managing your portfolio all this time.. I really don\'t have good advice for NOW. Intuitively, I\'m tempted to say shift to large cap tech stocks, but that\'s what\'s everyone\'s already doing and its greatly inflated, as we discussed P/E ratios are ridiculous. Chances are, a lot of money in large caps right now are retail investors trading on margin. What\'s the risk? March 23\'s crash could happen again but this time it might not bounce back. March 23\'s crash was induced by a credit squeeze as a cascade and massive heavy downpour of margin traders not able to meet maintenance requirements and forced to firesell their stock. In March, that was just the broad market in general. Now? Everyone and their grandma has their money thrown into tech stocks and I anticipate the next crash would disproportionately affect tech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now a lot of stock analysts/commentors you watch/read will say ""well where else would you put your money?"" They automatically assumed cash is not a valid option, probably because subconsciously, that\'s ""boring"". I interpret this as, ""Ya, we all know there are risks in the market, but come on, it\'s not reeeaaaally gonna happen... stonks will keep going up, riiiiiight?"" this mentality is like an alcoholic who just can\'t quit. \n\nThere\'s too many that can happen right now. November; School outbreak cases; School outbreaks that spreads back home; trade war escalations; upcoming bankruptcies/evictions, etc. etc. Like I said, past crashes were never pinpointed to any one singular event. It takes a series of events to ripple out and we don\'t know which or which ones will do it, and there\'s many events coming up in the next few months. I certainly don\'t think successful vaccine development alone (and what everyone forgets: Manufacture + deployment) can counteract all these factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) There are a lot of market noise right now. A lot of things happening now are going against past wisdom. My personal assessment for this is that the demographic for the stock market players has largely changed, which in turn greatly influences market trends and psychology.\n\n\\- Value-based investors have taken large chunks of their cash out expectin a bubble to burst.\n\n\\- Short-term traders surged, along with Robinhood ""investors"" (read: traders) is creating a dominance in short-term trading which increases the emphasis on technicals.\n\n\\- Technicals is king now, which is dangerous because technical analyses largely ignores news and company growth strategies. It\'s traditionally based on statistical data that included value-investors but now that most of the market are short-term traders technical trend graphs are more of a self-fulfilling prophecy because everyone buys into the ""heand and shoulders"" or whatever the shape of the day is. When stock price is based on self-fulfilling prophecies, that\'s also very dangerous. That\'s not how stocks are supposed to work; stocks are supposed to represent equity. Nowadays stocks behave more like Bitcoin which do not represent intrinsic value.', 'Maybe being a dick is his hobby!', ""Buying dividend stocks is no different than buying any other stocks. Most dividend stocks are not as volatile as many tech stocks. If you intend to hold them for a long period of time, it's often a good idea to dollar cost average into them. Diversify buy buying into four or five of the better ones. \n\nKeep in mind, you don't want to look JUST at the dividend yield. Owning shares in a company that pays a 10% dividend yield doesn't help you if the value of the stock drops every year. Buy stocks that pay a decent dividend but also have potential for some growth.\n\nSome that have done well for me are:  ABBV, AES, CPB, FRO, IBM, JPM, KO, MMM, PEP, T, and TD. This is certainly not an exhaustive list.\n\nWhen researching these stocks pay attention to the dividend yield. The best ones typically pay in the range between 3% and 5%.  Most stocks pay the dividends quarterly. Many REITs pay monthly. Ideally, you want the dividend to be reinvested into more stock.  (DRIP - Dividend ReInvestment Plan). The goal for many investors looking at stocks that pay good dividends is to build a portfolio that will provide good income when you retire without selling the stocks. You simply change the setting to pay you in cash rather than to reinvest back into more stocks at that point."", 'I think they figured “no expensive tastes/hobbies” == no hobbies.

There’s a lot of poor speculation in the community.  \n\nThings like their constantly decreasing warranty reserve.  That’s to be expected with a new car company, the more cars you build the more often you get it right the first time.  \n\nSame with the “bankruptcy is right around the corner” bit.  Their Reg credits are extremely lucrative, and, at their current stock price, a 2.5% issuance would wipe away their debt.  \n\nHowever there are a few criticisms I think are legitimate:  \n\nThey have limited appeal outside the US.  A majority of sales in the EU come from Mini, small, and medium segments.  Tesla has nothing that fits in those, and they’re paying for it.  Tesla has an easy time with market penetration when they have no real competitors, but the Renault Zoe, e-golf, and e-tron are all already building market share, the ID series comes out 2021.  Tesla May have a medium competitor by 2022.  Still no rumors for a mini or small competitor.  Currently they have 8% euro EV market share.  For all the bulls saying “I’m still waiting for EV competitors,” the wait is over.  The Zoe is the best selling EV in Europe. \n\nThey sold 1500 cars in Japan in 2019.  They need Cheaper, smaller options to effectively compete in China, and they’ll have a hell of a time getting market penetration if CCP domestics get there first.  \n\nUp next:  The cybertruck.  It’s hideous.  The bed is small and has limited accessibility compared to a typical truck.  Additionally, Rivian plans to roll out their pickup before the cyber truck, and the potential capacity of their Normal, IL facility is nothing to sneeze at.  I also doubt the cybertruck will have greater appeal to pickup buyers than Ford’s upcoming offering.  It’s just a weird novelty item. \n\nAnd lastly, Self driving:  \n\nTesla’s self driving capabilities are way overhyped.  GM’s Cruise subsidiary is working on similar “Robotaxi” ideas.  So is Google’s Waymo, which already has operations in multiple cities.  Apple’s Drive.Ai is also gunning for that market. So are Lyft and Uber.  There are tons of innovative and well capitalized companies aiming for the AV market.  And, unlike Tesla, many already have approval for commercial self driving experiments.  Just because Tesla is the loudest, doesn’t mean they’re the best.  Even if they are the first, there is tons of competition and I anticipate the market will become a commoditized, low margin business.  The AV revolution -if it ever comes- will be a paradigm shift in transport cost.  You can’t compare Tesla’s potential margins on the business to traditional taxis or current Uber.  It will be a cutthroat competition of Uber, Lyft, Apple, Tesla, and others hemorrhaging money to try and build market share.\n\nAnd, as a thought experiment, let’s say Tesla’s autopilot system is ready for commercial use, and they’re the first ones ready.  They ask the EU if they can be roll it out.  Daimler, VW, Volvo, and Renault all then collectively nudge the EU and say “We think there may still be some unresolved issues, and our projects really aren’t that far away.”  It would be an absolute nightmare for Tesla to get approval outside domestic markets, especially when their are domestics in those markets who the regulators will undoubtedly favor.  They were, just recently, and successfully, sued for false advertising about their autopilot in Germany.  Google and Apple also have massive piles of cash they would gladly use for lobbying if it meant Tesla failed and they got time to catch up (though I don’t think Waymo is the one who needs to catch up, au contraire).  \n\nTesla is overhyped.  Their global market penetration is limited by their range of big sedan, bigger sedan, big SUV, and bigger SUV.  They won’t be first to the lucrative pickup market, and their offering is a total joke.  They’re autopilot is the loudest, not necessarily the best, and their 18:1 price to sales and 11:1 price to assets just aren’t justifiable.', 'Wondering the same thing, rode it from 104 up above 300 and now back down, was considering adding to my position a bit but I think most of that runup was due to their COVID tests which it seems are now very far behind the tech from Abbot.', ""We've reached peak bubble."", 'There would be shorter term massive impacts to economic growth, no doubt.

The reason is because demand will surge back up and most likely we will have a massive economic boom period as people go back to doing ""normal"" stuff. People going out, vacationing and so on are all huge drivers of fossil fuel demand. You\'ll also have more economic activity in general. With this surge in demand, supply will not be able to ramp up quick enough. We do have supply in storage but even that won\'t be enough. It takes time to restart production. Lots of wells are just being shut in and drilling for new wells has fallen off a cliff. Most likely this surge in demand will also be occurring world wide because the vaccine will eventually be exported to every country in the world as well.\n\nMany people don\'t understand how oil wells actually work is why it is so hard for people to understand this. The gap between supply and demand in terms of world supply is only a few million barrels per day. Oil wells are not simply turning the knob on or off. It takes time to get new production online.\n\nPeople don\'t even realize that the oil glut doesn\'t exist anymore. In July, global oil demand was 93.4 MBD while supply was 91.8 MBD. The gap in supply and demand is coming from storage, probably oil tankers unloading that were previously being used to store oil from earlier months when price was below $10/bbl.\n\n[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global\\_oil.php](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.php)', 'I did know exactly when the bottom was down to the hour. Everything was beyond panic and into bewilderment and ""the world is ending"" in a financial sense. For the 2 hours before the very bottom I was looking at valuations and was entirely confused. Everything I was looking at was trading at levels lower than should be possible, even considering the circumstances. At the time I was looking at Capri Holdings and transfixed by its 5 dollar share price. I was also looking at REITs like Welltower and VTR. That\'s just what I happened to be looking at during the very market bottom. I got a phone call with a ""is the world ending"" question and it just snapped that it was now or never.  A little bit of volume and stability was returning, market makers were finally posting some bids with size in the option level 2, prices started to rise, and I slammed into VTR, Welltower, and CPRI LEAPS. I grabbed shares of Apple near 200, ASML at 193, KLAC, and LRCX as well as before the crash I wanted these companies. Also got Nokia at 2.43 for 5G exposure.\n\nYou won\'t see how bad it really was on that final day unless you really zoom in on the chart and look at the prices I just typed. For reference, my buy-in to CPRI was 5.97. Unless you\'re zoomed in you won\'t even see more than a single candle shadow that low, and it\'s half the price of what the bottom seems like at first glance. Things were trading for nothing. It was undeniably the bottom for anyone who wasn\'t in a complete state of shock.\n\nI did see the Fed pump the first trillion live. That was of course the turning point. I actually traded it immediately - I think I was in AAPL at the time, and the Fed pump saved a long I had open. The market actually faded the Fed after an initial pop, because it was confirmation of how bad things must be (the bond market was indeed blowing up).\n\nEvery day after the crash there would be little stories like the birth of the COVID stocks (facemask producers, etc), the start of the stay-at-home trend, etc, so there was always something to do. It felt like running with the pack and was very satisfying to stay on the pulse and understand why everything was doing what it was and where things would rotate next. After a day or two it would be outdated though and you\'d have to re-analyze the entire situation, but it was possible to stay ahead of the twists and turns, it wasn\'t just pure unpredictable chaos.\n\nI do remember the blowoff top before the crash too. I was trading Virgin Galactic on the short side, and going through that was just the final straw. I would drive in my car and listen to this specific part of a song that made me think about the market crashing over and over and over. Every day in my mind when I was trading I called it ""dancing on top of the world"". It was a very odd feeling. Very euphoric, and I had a bear conviction that kept building. It felt like slowly rising up the hill of a roller coaster rather than the parabolic blowoff you see in some stay-at-home tech stocks now. More like the extreme leverage and suppressed volatility (which as we know was a nuclear bomb waiting to go off) was inevitably marching everyone off of a cliff, which it was. As things got more extreme and vol stayed crushed, things got tighter and tighter so that any perturbation would cause increasingly forceful feedback loops just waiting to be broken out of the boundaries. Granted, I was exclusively trading right in the thick of the craziness before the crash so that\'s what I saw every day for the month before.\n\nEvery morning felt like strapping up to go to WW1 or something. You\'d just log in and say ""let\'s get killed"". Every day traders in the wrong place at the wrong time could just get ripped apart by a mortar out of nowhere.
