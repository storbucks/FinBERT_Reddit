Cheers! happy new year."", ""Here are some general guidelines; however, there is a lot more to successfully trading:\n\n1. What type of trader do you want to be? There are different types ranging from Day Traders and Option Traders to just Portfolio buyers (Vanguard is a popular one). Basically, as you move across the spectrum you're trading risk and time for potential profit and loss.\n2. If you decide to invest in stocks, instead of portfolios, (I don't do options personally) I would stick to industries you feel comfortable in. So, for me, that is Tech, Connected Devices, Gaming, and Health Industry. So these tend to be the areas I focus in so, for instance, you won't see me really investing in oil, finance, auto, etc. as I just don't know these industries as well as those four.\n3. If you're just starting out I would dedicate X hours a week (I do 4-5 personally) to researching and learning. As part of this, I think taking a few months to do virtual stock market trading isn't a bad idea as I don't feel like we're in a particularly high growth period for the next 2 months.\n\nAs for two specific questions you had:-  should I start using apps to manage stuff or just try and learn my self?I use Apps to track stocks I am interested in or own. I personally don't currently use any apps or programs to help identify trends, etc. in stocks for purchasing as my portfolio just isn't at the level to make high-velocity trading, which these programs are aimed at generally, to be worth it. I'm basically a quarterly trader more or less.\n\n\\-  Is it better to focus on single bigger stocks or multiple smaller ones? Any advice or tips much appreciated.At $2K my personally feeling is to focus that amount in 2-4 stocks. What you care about is % movement and it isn't always true that cheaper stocks can move more % because it is a function of the number of shares the company has and demand.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a great suggestion on a stock right now. I own Peloton and Corsair but I am likely selling Corsair within the next 6-10 weeks and not sure on Peloton but I wouldn't dare say either has a ton of running room left. Corsair I'm confident to say it doesn't and Peloton is hard to judge.... it could do +50% or drop 25% in 2021 I think.\n\nOther stocks I am currently tracking:MSFTLULU (bought Peloton over it)RAZFF (Razer)BABARoblox when it goes public (will likely buy-in)  \n\n\nEdit:   \nI personally do stocks and Vanguard (through Acorns). Stocks I am somewhat active on and Acorns is just there to force me to always be putting money away every year without consciously focusing on it. Good for about $1K this year and I do think Acorns (or similar programs) is worth it if you want to passively invest some without managing it."", 'I think CCP will assert it’s dominance, no doubt. But, BABA is too important to their economy, eventually the storm will pass. This could all blow up if congress cuts off trading of Chinese stocks, but I think that’s not very likely.\n\nAs with all these picks, they’re a small portion of my portfolio since it’s pretty speculative, so bag holding doesn’t hurt too bad.']"

Everything you said is a good point but I think that the CCP would rather mold Alibaba to fit their vision rather than make it disappear. But that’s just my opinion and I could very well end up being wrong', 'True, but I think those risks are already priced into the stock. And those seem like worst-case scenarios that I just don’t see happening (maybe they could but I just don’t see it personally). BABA is probably the most undervalued large-cap tech stock in the world. If anything bad happens with Amazon in the future, it’s shares will tank. I can’t see BABA going much lower. Any good news in the future will cause it to skyrocket. Look at BABA’s chart before all of this news. I think they will resume that growth once all of this blows over. Their numbers from Single’s day were insane', 'I don’t think China banning VIEs is the problem with them (though it’s certainly one). Being that you are not a shareholder or a liability holder, if the company were to go bankrupt, you are owed nothing. An individual company could delist its VIE and keep the money relatively without consequence. At least that’s my understanding. This seems especially risky with BABA in the sights of the CCP. One way or another, any Chinese stock is riskier than it’s USED counterpart, and riskier than a lot of other non-US equities.', 'This is a pretty good take. BABA could go lower but I took the opportunity to buy some shares when it dropped nearly 20% in one day. All I see is a great company on sale. I don’t try to time things. If it drops more then I’ll probably buy more', 'what happen to baba?

People never use them or see them again. People will moan about it for a day or two. Then they adapt and move on. Same thing could happen with BABA. They could disappear, and the CCP could easily promote a new company to provide all the services BABA provides. The situation here is nothing like west. Change happens quickly and efficiently with their style of government. \n\nI\'m not trying to say BABA won\'t continue, but people saying ""buy the dip"" like it can\'t happen aren\'t being realistic. China would easily drop one of its biggest companies, which is also challenging their power.', ""There are many uncertainties regarding BABA. Most likely the CCP has a feud with Ma only, and when he backs down everything returns to normal. Another possibility, though, is that the CCP is actually planning to fight tech monopolies in China, or even worse in this context, sees BABA's power specifically as a threat. Noone knows what the CCP might do then. The power they hold over the company is in theory near infinite. If they want, they could nationalize it.\n\nThat's very unlikely but we are talking about a dictatorship which never attacked one of it's corporate giants the way it does with Ma/Baba now...we will see.\n\nI would not load up Baba right now. I see it at best hovering around current value in the short term, with huge risk of dropping further. If I want to gamble with hyped tech stocks there are other plays, even just in China."", 'I just hope every BABA investor knows they don’t own shares and understand how VIEs work.', 'Alibaba intelligence', 'Alibaba intelligence', 'True, but as long as BABA is fine then it doesn’t matter if it’s a VIE. The CCP won’t ban the use of VIE’s. They know the consequences of doing that would be very bad. It would probably escalate China and the US into a Cold War. China has stated numerous times that they don’t want to escalate things with the US', ""There will be a small drop Monday as people panic sell. The CCP isn't going to let one of their biggest businesses fail and they aren't going to push investors out of Chinese companies. Jack isn't even the CEO of Baba anymore. Jack is fucked but BABA is the CCP's baby. It'll go back up within the week. It's the amazon/google of China.

The subsequent crashes has to do with political risks that BABA is facing. These include: monopolistic practices, halting of ANT IPO from China, Jack Ma being missing (for some reason is a concern, even though he\'s no longer the CEO), and now with the US blocking AliPay, and Trump signing executive orders to delist some Chinese companies. The decline today has to do with speculation that they are looking into expanding the list of Chinese companies to delist.\n\nInvesting in BABA right now requires a lot of research and you need to be able to stomach the political risks with companies operating in China. Also an important point is that when you buy ""BABA"" you aren\'t buying an actual share ownership of the company. You are buying an ADR - a shell company because the Chinese govt does not allow foreign investors. This is also another huge risk that comes with owning Chinese stocks.\n\nEdit: If you\'re a beginner, I probably wouldn\'t suggest investing in something so complicated unless you really do your DD.

It almost seems too good to be true. And because in large cap stocks the efficiency of the market is almost all the time on fleek, there is a reason why the market attributes a huge discount to the stock.\n\nFrom what I see or would assume is that this discount has its roots in the fact that it’s a Chinese Company. \nIf we measured the company by the ration e.g. amazon has (and amazon has these measurements rightly so), BABA would be worth double or triple it’s current market cap. \nThe reason for this discount is the political circumstances and the CCP.\n\nIf the CCP wanted, they could delist BABA, split it for antitrust reasons or for whatever reason they can make up, ban foreign investors from investing, prohibit the ADR rules or just simply destroy and dissolve the company. Not because there is a legal background to do so but just because it’s the CCP and China has basically no rule of law. \n\nSo the valuation of BABA is kinda arbitrary, you could assign it a 10 P/E, a 20 P/E, a 40 P/E or like amazon a 80 P/E. Everything is possible and it’s valuation is completely arbitrary. \n\nSo what prevents me from investing in Chinese ADRs is exactly this political factor that with the blink of an eye China could destroy the entire value for shareholders. We basically only hold a shell company with no substance whatsoever. \n\nAnd that btw is the same with all other ADRs from China (every China based stock is an ADR).

There's always these hit pieces in Western media all the time about how China sucks, this and that, all the time. The more China's economy grows, the more you will probably see that back and forth.

The second is ARM which is part of a pending deal with Nvidia which would see Softbank get an 8% or so stake in Nvidia if it goes through, there\'s a reasonable chance it falls through and personally I think it\'s fine either way. The third is the Vision Fund projects as a whole. The original Vision Fund is 30% stockholder money with somewhat mixed results, the 2nd is entirely stockholder money that\'s done well, between the 2 there are about 140 investments with the recent success stories being Doordash and Coupang. IMO those are the 3 big ones that have more upside/downside. \n\nThen you\'ve got the ""strategic holdings"" of Softbank Corps (telecom in Japan) which I think they mostly hold onto for the dividends, though they sold a chunk of it the last year. Some chunk remaining of Tmobil, which they sold most of their stake of once Sprint started merging with them. Yahoo Japan, which is the preferred search engine and email service for the Japanese language (powered by Google ironically). Northstar which is part of a ""liquidity management strategy"", a subsidiary in the Caymans where they park excess cash after selling assets in publicly traded tech stocks (and options). And the Latin America Fund which is smaller scale investment than the vision fund (managed by a different guy as well) with about 130 last I knew investments in tech companies through the region. \n\nGoing forward I think we\'ll continue to see the trend of the last year or so, which is whittling down more of the bigger assets to cycle into more venture fund money, and I think that\'s really where the upside of the stock is. They make a lot of bets but many of them have big enough upside to actually matter for investors. Softbank just gives you substantial exposure to the venture capital market that you can\'t get exposure to through any other stock. Also it gives you an excuse to watch Masa\'s bizarre earnings reports. \n\nThere are also 4 SPACs associated with Softbank people, 3 being publicly traded now that haven\'t announced a merger target yet.', 'It can’t get much lower, 90% of stuff on Amazon comes from Alibaba.

2021-03-30,"['Lotta paper hands these days! Just yesterday there was a guy only in the market for two months saying he cashed out and to sell anything ""wonky"" like Tesla, BABA, GE etc.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/', '&gt; I think someone with experience realizes that there\'s always a bear case to be made with any stock. The fact that you listed out some bearish arguments for some hot stocks - that\'s not really new news to anybody who\'s making educated investments.\n\nThat\'s the thing.  I wasn\'t making educated investments.  I bought in on a whim and later realized I hadn\'t properly weighed the risk.  For me *personally* BABA, for example, isn\'t worth it right now.  It also wasn\'t worth it when I bought it, it\'s just that I wasn\'t making smart decisions as a first-time investor.  It\'s not really because of the (presumably temporary) price drop.  The temporary price drop just made me realize that ""ugh, I\'m not really cool losing money on this"".  Someone else might have a different risk tolerance.  I wasn\'t totally aware of what my risk tolerance was until I started seeing it in action.\n\n&gt; So that includes the stocks you don\'t feel ""wonky"" about. There\'s bearish arguments for Apple, Microsoft, Costco, etc. And then you make a curious statement about how you don\'t get rich by investing in what everyone else does (using Keith Gill as an example).... but you\'re saying you want to invest in blue chip stocks - which is exactly what everyone else invests in.\n\nNo, you misunderstood.  This was directed at people who think they can spot the next GME like Keith Gill did.  He spotted GME a year ago or so when it was trading around $4.  Many of the people thinking they found something revolutionary with Tesla got in at all time highs.\n\nI\'m not a good stock picker.  That\'s why I prefer blue chip.\n\n&gt; So your messaging ends up sounding like you just got burned on some hyped meme stocks that were suggested to you over the past couple months. I think you should consider Bogleheads style investing. Look it up.\n\nI don\'t think you actually understood where I\'m coming from or the reasons for what I\'ve done.  Also, I made money on GME.', 'Yes think long-term with Alibaba.

I don’t buy Chinese stocks for that reason but the uncertainty with China has always been here since 2008 so why did you even buy in the first place knowing that risk as been there for awhile. Out of GE because of a “wonky reverse stock split” like unless your a day trader this means nothing to a long term investor. If you believe in the company long term it doesnt really matter what they do with their stock. So once again why even buy in the first place. Also wont buy ARKK because of “wonky god talk”? The god talk has always been here for a long while ever since she first started managing money. Back in December and January this sub loved Cathie Wood and don’t you dare say anything bad or prepare for the downvotes or how she and her stocks are the future and people are holding long term. Now that the hype has died off because everyone turned against her now and are now bringing up “god talk” is the reason they sold and not because the stock is down over 30%. So much for the long term investing strategy and the future lol. The point is your post basically encourages a buy high sell low mentality.

This shows he still has bargaining power.\n\nI’m no expert, but suspect the interests of Ma and the Chinese government are largely the same, that they need each other to prosper and both know it.\nMa obviously can’t go against the party, it would be business (and potentially personal) suicide. He has little reason to do so, aside maybe personal ideals. Still in the past he has shown willingness to bow if needed.\n\nThe party wants to control power and information, and a growing stable economy. They want China to be a leader of the world and its successful business is reason of proudness.\nThis is more easily accomplished ensuring the loyalty of business leaders, rather than dismantling what they have built.\n\nBABA trades at a relatively low PE. Even if new government regulation was shrinks its profits and ability to grow, the risk is probably already priced in.\n\n\nGME is interesting for the opposite reason. It’s highly speculative and volatile.

If not, what endgame are we all playing for or are we betting on price action?', '(fuck, this got long...oh well)\n\nI\'m hardly one to judge but I don\'t think you\'re crazy. \n\nI\'m bullish on BABA but I think the recovery will take a little time. I also think that will happen before the end of the year and may all happen in a few days. Here are the catalysts imo that take it back to $300:\n\n1. ~~BABA pays big fine for anti-competitive practices~~\n2. ~~Agrees to drop pick-1-of-2 rule (which of course they have to b/c RCEP)~~\n3. Jack Ma divests from Ant Group. I think there\'s fire under this smoke. The CCP does love winning personality conflicts and divesting Ma from Ant would be their favorite kinda fuck-you without costing the company anything. BABA/Ant can still be all the behemoth they want to be without Ma. Still Ma\'s exit could take a few weeks to sort-out the details. I think Ma might be less peeved about it than people think. There\'s a chance he was going to exit Ant after the IPO anyway, sorta like he moved-on from BABA.\n4. Ant Group gets greenlight for IPO as a normal-ish bank (not a loan-writing factory). That\'s going to be like at $20 day for BABA easy imo. There\'s just so little bear case for BABA outside of ""well, the CCP is gonna git \'em!"". Once all the shoes have dropped, BABA\'s P/E might shoot back up to other tech giants. \n\nOnce Ant IPO\'s and (perhaps) Ma is out of the picture, I think you might see the CCP flipping script and getting back to pushing BABA (and similar companies) to expand and grow into the markets that RCEP has created. The anti-monopoly actions are alibi\'s for the WTO dimension of a future conflict the CCP is interested in winning: the battle for pacific market expansion. The PRC needs the appearance of due diligence. They want to look like a country that\'s hard on monopolies and still have monopolies. (Same as the US). RCEP is the biggest trading block on the planet. The US isn\'t in it. And the PRC finished it on the heels of 4 years of the most fucking moronic foreign policy execution in the history of the USA. (Anybody\'s feathers get ruffled by the last statement, I\'d be glad to make that point in long form).\n\nPRC\'s actions against BABA are by design 20:1 bark-to-bite ratio. Eventually it will recover as the theatrics conclude.', 'As per Blackrock, global investors are underinvested in China. I advise that you buy the dip on BABA, JD, and BIDU until they’re 10% of your portfolio.', 'I’m in shares for the long run.  BIDU accounts for 74% of Chinese search queries and has a 78b market cap.  That market cap seems very low to me, speculative or not.  BABA is a behemoth with a ton of cash.   I’m willing to bet that the market eventually agrees.', 'As someone who had a 3-4 year abusive relationship with baba, just set your expectations beneath the floor', 'BIDU and BABA are 2 of my biggest losers.  I’m an options player and those positions expire in May and June so I’m hoping for a quick 10-20% run-up.  Very frustrating seeing growth stocks trading at 15-25 PE', 'Most companies may not in the st, but BABA is comparatively undervalued and will almost definitely return to ath’s. They’d have to have some pretty spectacular earnings to do it by EOY. Prob pops quite a bit whenever they get ANT sorted', ""Disclosure; I have BABA for 3 years now\n\nI think you're giving the company or yourself a lot of pressure. Unless your options are expiring soon, it could take it's sweet time until this whole thing with Xi blows over. \n\nThe company is massive and it's future potential is undeniable, perhaps $300/350+ by next year this time would be as realistic as you can get. \n\nLet it shake off this bad period, then it will be back to it's rally. Especially if you're really long on the company"", 'Not at all. If nobody was worried about future crackdowns on BABA or the CCP inviting favored competitors to play in their arena the stock would be $400-$500 overnight. \n\nAlso, there’s no future war with China and nobody believes that will happen (thank god). Stock market would already be around zero if that was about to happen.', 'Anyone who actually lives in China knows how BABA is doing/is perceived with increased e-commerce competition from Meituan, JD, and Pinduoduo? Feel like this thread is about CCP, Jack Ma, and delisting but those aren’t at the top of the list of things I care about with this company.', 'BABA is a really great company with an amazing culture. I had the pleasure of working with a subsidiary on a consulting basis and it was an absolute pleasure. \n\nIt’s really easy to look at BABA’s performance and draw the conclusion it’s a $500 stock. \n\nThat being said, the CCP is pissed off at their founder and the CCP directs the show. They’ve chosen others to play the lead roles in said show. BABA will be facing a major headwind for the remainder of its days.', 'BABA lagging is much more about BABA and CCP’s relations', ""I recently bought into BABA for a large portion of my portfolio because it's inevitable."", 'I am 90% on BABA right now, trust me and hold. At least 320+ EOY. Market can remain irrational longer than you think.', 'If you look at the baba umbrella the potential is limitless', 'A lot of hedgefunds are buying BABA.. the rally is coming.. \n\nAlso 100% of analysis across the globe have BABA at over $300 in next 12 months...  crazy i know..', 'They settled with a slap on the wrist. That’s all it’s ever going to be. Baba is too important to China for Xi to cripple them. He just needs to save face. Same song and dance with US Congress and big tech. Obviously there are differences in the culture, but both governments know the value that these companies provide in a globally competitive market.\n\nCapitalism is a drug and once you’re on the drip, you cannot get off without bloodshed and revolution. China isn’t doing that again anytime soon. \n\nI sleep well at night holding BABA. It’s probably the most undervalued company on the NYSE. Until big US investors start abandoning ship, I’m going to hold. Blackrock, Vanguard, and TRowe Price own over 35B worth of this stock.', 'The price of this and other Chinese stocks is going to correlate with US-China relations. I think BABA will be $300 at some point, but I dont think it will be anytime soon.', 'For an index it’s pretty unlikely, but a lot of individual stocks are pretty volatile. In fact it would be very unusual if a stock like alibaba didn’t see a 30% difference between its high and its low within any 12 month period. Obviously it could go down just as easily as it could go up, so you can’t rely on it going up in a short amount on time, but it’s definitely not unrealistic. Consistently making 30% a year is unrealistic, but individual stocks often fluctuate that much.', 'Isn\'t baba sus as fuck?\n\nLike remember when Jack Ma just vanished? Tbh i\'m always warey of Chinese companies after watching ""The China Hustle"". It\'s too open for fraud.', 'Sure bet but timing is not certain. BABA needs Amazon type valuation.', ""It's not. BABA has 45% of chinese cloud market and if this keeps growing the stock will easily quadruple over the next few years imo.\n\nAt the same time JD.COM is the superior ecommerce stock!!

If it doubles before 5 years thats a bonus."", 'Im buying as much BABA as I can.', 'I hope it doesn’t lift any time soon.

Probs best to wait till you get most your money back and then reevaluate after that.', 'Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.', ""30% of my poorfolio is in BABA, so no, I didn't do good this week, or this month, or these last 6 months.

If you had a reasonably built portfolio, not so much, a few of your holdings may have seen a bit of pain but that\'s about it, others would have done well to compensate. **If you\'re building a portfolio look at commodities, bonds, REITs, and diversify across geographies and sectors for christsake.** \n2. ***Volatility***: There\'s risk and there\'s volatility. They are not the same. If you hold a stock like PLTR which has a monthly standard deviation of about 10%, don\'t be surprised when it goes up or down 10% in a month. That\'s normal and expected. It\'s still something to consider, but you should be prepared for it because it happens all the time.

They are still investing extremely much, a small amount of revenue is currently profit. Amazons P/E could therefore decrease substancially because of profit explosion during the years to come. Alibaba is already extremely profitable, hard to increase the percent of revenue that goes to profit. But Alibaba is at a forward P/E around 20 I think, so they don’t need to be more profitable to be a extremely good stock.

2021-05-27,"['DKNG and BABA. BABA is a friggin monster of a company. They have enough cash to pour into R&amp;D and still have a ton of money left over. DKNG because they’re partnering with all the right people. MLB, NFL, UFC, WWE.', 'SQ, FUBO, DKNG, BABA etc', 'So, there\'s a common misconception for a number of investors between *risk* and *volatility*. Volatility refers purely to price action - how dispersed prices are around the mean. Volatility really just gives you a frame of reference for the typical distribution profile of some investment. Risk, on the other hand, is the chance that an event has an effect on the investment thesis. This can include known risks (regulatory risk, which materialized with BABA as legal harassment from the CCP) and unknown risks (like with early stage companies, where there is an indefinite number of things that can go wrong leading up to profitability). \n\n Not investment advice, but major things I\'d look at here in terms of risk: \n\n1. The distinction between the Momentum Index and the Momentum Tilt index. Make sure you know which one you want - the former is riskier by virtue of being less diversified. \n2. What\'s in the rest of your portfolio? One thing to be careful of with factor ETFs is that many can have you unknowingly over-exposed to the same particular companies. For instance, if your other holdings (even if ETFs) are heavily weighted to AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and AAPL you\'re going to be adding idiosyncratic exposure to these companies by virtue of the fact that they are ""high momentum"" currently. Look at the sector/ region exposure while you\'re at it. \n3. The biggest thing that worries me about this is the ad-hoc rebalancing criteria. The index rebalances twice a year (quite infrequent, in the scheme of things) and has an ad-hoc rebalancing criteria that seeks volatility above the 95th percentile of index history. I would do a little work in a spreadsheet to find out what this means in practice, because you may wind up about 6 months behind major market regime shifts. Try comparing this to other ETFs with similar style tilts while you\'re at it.', 'if you invest in baba you deserve to lose all your money', 'BABA, FB, GTEC, TTCF, WBA, AI, AMZN', ""I agree with this, BABA and Tencent are basically china tech ETFs, they own stakes/own completely really high growth businesses. \n\nMELI is similar to SE, except they're the dominant e-commerce player in LATAM ($70B market cap).They also have Mercado Pago, their fintech/payments business which is also the leader there and their own logistics network, but SE has gaming.  Growing fast like SE, triple digit% revenue growth.\n\nLatin America is a really low penetration market and   MELI is building a competitive advantage by having an Amazon-style shipping network. So this means that shoppee for example can't stroll in and take market share as easily. Apart from that MELI would be profitable, just barely.\n\nAnd their valuation isn't terrible either, 14 times price to sales, which is good since they were trading at 20-30 earlier this year. There is currency risk but all their results are FX neutral so their Brazilian real revenue growth is even more impressive.""]"

Google ""recent audit failure examples"" you will get enough articles from just 2019/2020. \n\nBesides as far as BABA is concerned, my first comment literally started with a disclaimer about BABA as i was and still am talking about effectiveness of audits in uncovering fraud.  \n\nYou\'ve been all over in your argument, may just be trolling me for fun. So here i will stop responding to you further.', ""BABA is clearly in a huge bear trend, there might be some positive reaction, but ultimately it will go down further. But hey, maybe this is bottom? I wouldn't take that risk, would rather wait for some real confirmation a reversal has begun."", 'Okay. Firstly, if big money is to buy into any market, there has to be a lot of supply of the security so that they can get a reasonable piece of the pie. You\'d be happy with 100 shares, they\'d most likely be happy holding 10 million shares. This means their profit is increased should the security (stock) perform well over time.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding off from the example I shared above of say Black Rock buying into BABA and they have $2billion to put in. \n\nScaling in would mean they place what is called ""icebag orders"" at different price levels probably close but not too obviously close to each other. If the aim is to accumulate 10 million shares, the icebag orders will usually be at $245/share - maybe 200k shares. Followed by $240/share for another 200k shares. Since this is a decently sized position, the share price will move in waves, dropping lower and lower.\n\n\n\nThe drop in price means there\'s a lot of uninformed investors selling (abandoning their positions) because maybe they\'re losing faith in the company or fear and hopelessness, in the process supplying those shares right into the hands of big money - meaning they accumulate even more shares as price drops. \n\n\nThe reason for their orders to be iceberg (_an iceberg order means that it\'s an order that\'s been broken up into smaller bite sizes so that each order fill contributes into the big money investor\'s overall position of $2billion_) is so that as they get filled, they don\'t offset price and cause an unnecessary bump or rally in price and ruining their risk to reward ratio. Think of it as the tip of the iceberg\n\n\nOnce big money has accumulated their $2bil position at maybe ~$220 DCA, the stock now will be in ""strong hands"" - investors who are fully committed and unwilling to sell their positions resulting to price eventually reacting positively to good news or price target valuations by ""renowned"" stock analysts in Wall Street.', ""They don't issue regular shares because they don't want to give up ownership.\nChina doesn't care about foreign investor's rights, only their money. If they screwed foreign investors, foreign money will flow out. That is not what they want. China's goal is world domination, and  only megacap tech can help make this a reality. No doubt the CCP are invested in BABA and Tencent, and see their shares as currency to get richer off. But the issue was Ma's arrogance and growing power, and ANT encouraging over levered loans to the public.  BABA isn't just any company, it's part of China's duopoly of tech."", 'Until there is new information, very little likely to change.  BABA looks like great value on paper and when using traditional metrics such as P/E, especially compared to US counterparts like AMZN, but risks remain due to CCP actions and US-China trade war and political risks.

So tell me, how many public companies since 2009 were found to be cooking the books so much so as to cause a sizeable loss for investors? How many? You are in a thread about BABA, so stating you cannot trust auditing firms serves to ignite fears that BABA's financials maybe fraudulent. No, the probability is much higher they are in good standing based on being an NYSE listed company who is being audited by a big established firm. No red flags have been raised, whereas in your W.irecard example, several sources raised concerns with W.irecards's accounting since the beginning. And it was finally their own auditors who revealed things might not be kosher."", 'Do your research go with your gut and stick to your decision until how you feel about the stock changes.

(Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.

These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks.\n\nIWF - This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include RWGV and VONG. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than VOO/SPY, less volatile than QQQ.

This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.

The majority of the population got fed up with the ruling party and replaced them with a new Prime Minister who\'s very much pro-market. That\'s why you may have occasionally heard about the new telco licenses for the Ethiopian market, one of which was granted, as well as the ongoing partial (40%) privatization of Ethio Telecom, the state-run telecommunications monopoly.\n\nAnyways, to go back to those links, ordinarily, it makes no sense for Ethiopian Airlines (and by extension, the carrier\'s owner, the Ethiopian Government) to let Boeing get away with a light settlement . . . until you read the FANA news report from Addis Ababa about a delegation of Boeing executives meeting with agents of the Ethiopian government to discuss ""investment opportunities in Ethiopia.""\n\nBottom line: I think that the Ethiopian government has extracted something else from Boeing in the wake of the 2019 737 MAX crash, something that is worth far more than cash and that may be a win-win for both sides . . . especially with the country\'s opening up, the push for regional integration and harmonization of laws and processes with international standards, and Ethiopia\'s strategic position in the Horn of Africa with regards to logistics. (Part of the agreement with Eritrea is for the Ethiopians to regain access to the Red Sea at Massawa; in the last two years, the Ethiopians secured an agreement with the French government to begin re-establishing naval forces that were disbanded after Eritrea gained independence.) As the Ethiopians move forward, this may yield advantages and opportunities for Boeing, since Ethiopia will inevitably become a ""gateway"" or a ""hub"" for access to Africa, much like it was in ancient times.']"

The need for secure, easy-to-develop applications with strong performance at the edge will only continue to grow.
