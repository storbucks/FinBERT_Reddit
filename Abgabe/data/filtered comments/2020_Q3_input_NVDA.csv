AMD Renoir Ryzen 4000 series outclasses NVDA MX250 and comes close to MX350. Intel Tiger Lake coming later this year will be more powerful than Renoir (based off leaks certainly in synthetic benchmarks). Also, there have been numerous rumors of AMD Van Gogh APU and Cezanne Zen 3 APU with RDNA2 architecture. On the high performance laptop, for now RDNA is similar to Turing on perf/W. I expect penetration of RDNA based laptops soon but real game changer would be RDNA2. 50% perf per watt on similar process and is the same tech that goes in to next gen consoles. So all in all trend is clear. Much powerful graphics embedded in the CPU. NVDA does not have x86 IP and ARM just cannot take high performance x86 cores soon enough.\n\nOn the HPC space, NVDA is not found in any of the 3 exa flop supercomputer contracts. 2 was awarded to AMD and 1 to Intel (All Cray). Based off current NVDA offering for HPC, one would say they have superior products by far but none of NVDA product was able to make it in those super computers. Reason is simple heterogeneous computing. Based off rumors, Custom Milan (Zen 3) APUs will be installed in one of the supercomputer.\n\nSimilarly, AMD is developing architecture especially for data center HPC/AI workloads that will be placed against HPC volta/Ampere. Before AMD used to have same architecture for both gaming and data cente/AI.\n\nFor now I would say NVDA is doing great on the desktop and mobile front but there is a reason for it. AMD does not have high end graphics card to compete against NVDA. Tables will turn once AMD launches RDNA2 GPUs. RDNA2 will have 50% increase in performance per watt and is the same architecture that powers PS5 and Xbox One series X. And we all know How poor NVDAs strategy/ implementation for RTX turned out.

Also think the PS5 will sell well which is AMD.\n\nTSLA: I think they will be dominant in many sectors.

Mobile payments/digital wallets are only going to grow too, giving currently bank less people banks in their pockets (SQ own cash app).\n\nINRG: Clean energy ETF, haven’t researched this sector enough to pick a singular stock and with so many methods of renewable energy, I thought at the moment it’s best to stick with an ETF that covers a lot of them. \n\nI also have Apple but plan to sell after they announce brilliant iPhone 12 sales (imo).', ""I would say it depends on the risk you're willing to take.

2020-07-19,"[""It may also be worth looking at this from another angle. You've already shown an interest in some diversification, given your broad accumulation of tech stocks rather than betting on an individual one. And you list an interest in additional companies, 2 payment / financials and 3 healthcare related.\n\nA lot of the focus on long term investing is based on the minimization of downside. Ex: Suppose one company from your list of 7 tech stocks got banned from a country (we're seeing the beginnings of this with Huawei, likely expect some retaliation). How exposed are you to that negative news?\n\nBy constructing your own collection of 7+ tech stocks, you'll end up re-creating your own mini diversified ETF. By adding additional sectors into your investment portfolio, you're diversifying your risk from one sector into multiple. The end result is an actively managed portfolio where you do all the work. If you value your time / energy spent on managing stocks in this portfolio, you're effectively paying a fee for this actively managed portfolio. At the very least, you're spending your free time.\n\nSuppose you want to focus on a tech-heavy portfolio, but from a less actively managed standpoint. You can pick up an etf, like VGT for example, that focuses on just the tech sector. From the top asset holdings as of 6/30, that etf holds AAPL, MSFT, V, M, INTC, NVDA, Adobe, Cisco, Paypal, Salesforce with roughly 60% of it's assets. This is actually pretty well aligned with your current collection of stocks. There are individual sector ETFs, dividend growth ETFs, disruptive tech ETFs, and broad market ETFs. It's important to recognize when the collection of stocks you end up with actually aligns with a broader index. Arguably your current portfolio and intended direction seems like 40% VGT and 30% VHT. If later you want to add exposure to other parts of the economy, you might end up with a mix of multiple individual sector ETFs, which might end up having significant overlap with the S&amp;P500 or VTI (total market ETF). A long road to end up at a broad market ETF.\n\nThe important thing about ETFs that track benchmarks / indices is that the index is a moving target. Right now there are discussions about TSLA being included in the S&amp;P 500, which would kick some other company out. All the S&amp;P index tracking funds would adjust to this new definition of the index, and all passive investors would then be exposed to TSLA. This is true for many of the index tracking funds, the index definition can change and the funds change to reflect that.\n\nIn trying to outperform an index, you're making a bet that you can pick stocks that do better than the continually evolving indices that track economic growth of various sectors. It's always worth evaluating whether you can outperform the 7-9% long term avg the S&amp;P500 returns, and how much effort it takes for you to do that. By spending a lot of time and effort on stocks, you're spending time trying to improve performance on current savings. Your time could also be spent acquiring skills to increase your earning potential, increasing future savings.\n\nTL;DR: Upgrade your portfolio to sector ETFs, eventually to VTI."", 'If it’s a fair bit, maybe split it up and look for something that has a little more room for growth.

You can buy plenty of stocks with the realistic possibility of 10x gains in 5 years where the most likely scenario is simply much more modest gains or, in a realistic worst case scenario, a modest loss before the company is bought out.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia has a realistic chance of 10x gains in 5 years as they have a modestly growing gaming segment, fast growing data center and AI segments, with autonomous vehicles and associated AI/data center growth essentially a coiled spring ready to explode but not yet contributing any meaningful revenue. If that takes off within 3-4 years, they could hit 10x in the 5 year window. But it’s not like they’re just going to fall off the map if it doesn’t. \n\nZoom has a realistic chance of becoming the de facto method for business communication. With a few more 250% YoY growth quarters still to come, they could have a big head start by next year.   \n\nOr look at any one of the high growth enterprise software companies with a smaller market cap. MongoDB, Alteryx, Twilio, PayCom, Okta, CrowdStrike, Datadog, Fastly, etc. If they had a meaningful drop in share price there is a good chance a company like Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Salesforce, or Oracle would just buy them out. So they aren’t going to zero. But if they’re able to keep up growth with only mild declines in growth rate over 5 years, they could reasonably increase revenues by 10-20x in 5 years and with a relatively stable valuation they would also be worth 10x.', 'Those are pretty good large cap choices in my opinion but you may want to consider a core index fund for similar exposure to large caps with added diversity.

AMD is “budget” in the sense where they will be 2% behind in performance to an equivalent intel cpu (or Nvidia gpu) but at the same time be 20%-30% cheaper \n\nThey are obliterating intel for the foreseeable future and they’re being put in the next gen consoles too', ""TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both."", ""I think it actually helps AMD that NVDA is diversifying their business.

At best, they will market perform. Look elsewhere. Other semi’s like TSM, AMD, NVDA do well for reasons.', 'I\'m not the right person to ask tbh. Above, I was mainly arguing two points:\n\n- NVidia is not necessarily overvalued (or even ""fully"" valued) just on the basis that they crossed above Intel\'s market cap because the eventual total addressable market for CPUs (within SoCs with various accelerators) might be much larger than the current x86 market (which companies such as NVidia (and others) *could* eventually disrupt, absorb and take from Intel).\n\n- If indeed Intel\'s difficulties continue, then I don\'t see this as just 100% bullish on AMD ie it could just lead to an overall decline in the x86 market (and therefore I think we should really pay heed to Apple switching to ARM).\n\nNowhere am I not acknowledging that AMD also makes ARM-based SoCs, that\'s just not the vector that people usually use to make forecasts about AMDs future (rather, they have their eyes on Intel\'s current revenues).\n\nHaving said all that, my own cost basis for my NVDA shares is $139.50 (man do I envy the people who got in at $20). I would absolutely buy a lot more if we saw the stock fall substantially (e.g. to somewhere near $200). Not probable, but not impossible either given how volatile the stock is. The stock is very expensive, so I would not get into a large position at the current levels. But if I had to buy one of them, I\'d buy NVDA. Important to emphasize however that I invest for the long term (think 5 years from now and longer). If you look at NVidia as a company, they\'ve had some good luck historically, but they are a terrific company with a great track record.\n\nINTC (although you probably didn\'t ask about INTC), I might still buy INTC if it falls substantially (say we see a price close to $30). Despite their difficulties, they can always turn around and e.g. Altera alone is worth a lot as a business.\n\nAMD, I have no idea. I don\'t trade, but if I did, then maybe the ""short INTC, long AMD"" trade has some runway left still. Like I said, long term, I am not bullish on x86 servers (and certainly not desktop) anymore. But short term, if Intel\'s difficulties persist, who knows how long that trade could last.', 'nvda tsm amd\n\nedit: is what I assume', 'Apple also recently announced they’re moving away from intel, to their own custom ARM chipsets.

Microsoft will probably see an uptick in interest around their ARM surface books too as ARM becomes a more supported/adopted platform for laptops. I think this trend alone is a huge deal.\n\nSony and Microsoft are almost ready to release their next gen consoles, both based on AMD.\n\nAMD also grew its server market share in the last couple of years, going from basically nothing at about 10% which is pretty crazy.

Thanks.', ""This is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. Should give you an idea of what they've been up to\n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both."", 'I have known abt these semiconductor/computer companies for years now but never knew that Nvidia was only around 50 bucks in 2016. Since then, their growth has been enormous. Surely demand and exposure for TSMC will go up in coming years with many large companies (apple, amd, maybe intel, nvidia) outsourcing their manufacturing to them. I’m hoping that translates to increased market value in the coming years.', 'OK yes: Nvidia, because they have Mellanox (Mellanox is a great company and their only serious competitor for HPC is Solarflare (now owned by Xilinx)). I think I did allude to the fact that for my (anecdotal) use case, NIC performance &amp; integration would be paramount (vs being stuck with PCI and its limitations). With the Mellanox acquisition, Nvidia is clearly going for the HPC/cloud server business in a big way.\n\nAMD can do it too, but all I was saying is you have to then look much farther than just the current story of stealing Intel\'s x86 CPU revenues: I believe that the future of server space will be much more about integrated SoCs vs selling CPU chips for OEM mobos. You do make a good point re: clients connecting their own designs. There\'s already a lot of stuff out there that you can do things with (Xilinx FPGAs with ARM cores etc). But for something to scale (customers\' needs, time to market), I think it needs to be an out-of-the-box integrated system running Linux with full NIC support etc. so that I can just compile the software and run it like I would today on a Xeon or an AMD server.\n\nAs for Intel, yes they have Altera and a bunch of stuff, but they have their difficulties now (and a long track record of failing e.g. with their mobile Atom stuff).\n\nWhen you say ""x86\'s inherent advantages over ARM"", what exactly do you have in mind?

Intel enjoys a special relationship with Microsoft for many years. Currently their CPU business unit is having problems. I suspect it's something similar to Microsoft when Ballmer was CEO. But I believe it's a temporary setback which Intel will overcome. Intel still has over 70% of CPU market share. Currently it's highly undervalued and trading at very low P/E ratio.\nAMD on other hand is growing very fast, however expectations are much higher than growth rate. AMD is currently extremely overvalued and share price has priced in high growth for the next 2-3 years. CPU and GPU are 2 main revenue sources of AMD, however in GPU, Nvidia is always one step ahead and any advances in GPU quickly disappear. Current CPU architecture is better compared to Intel, so there are high hopes for AMD to take market share from Intel. However, history of AMD shows that such outperformance is only temporary and Intel will come back with better designs.\nLong term I'd invest in Intel, however with a couple months horizon, AMD can bring a good profit."", 'No, I was speculating about the future of x86 server.

AMD are winning as they're offering more cores across the board for the same price. That's why they're cutting deep in high end servers. Epyc is a better product than anything Intel can offer, with better performance and less heat.\n\nI agree PC's are a limited market and I don't think Nvidia or AMD want to be dedicated to it either, but again it's important because of the influence those regular users hold that trickles down to every sector.\n\nI think [this](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3435727/two-amd-epyc-processors-crush-four-intel-xeons-in-tests.html#:~:text=ServeTheHome%20ran%20tests%20comparing%20the,28%20cores%20and%2056%20threads.&amp;text=So%2C%20two%20Epyc%207742%20processors,much%20as%20the%20AMD%20chips.) proves my point about server performance\n\n&gt; ServeTheHome ran tests comparing the AMD Epyc 7742, which has 64 cores and 128 threads, and the Intel Xeon Platinum 8180M with its 28 cores and 56 threads. The dollars, though, show a real difference. Each Epyc 7742 costs $6,950, while each Xeon Platinum 8180M goes for $13,011. So, two Epyc 7742 processors cost you $13,900, and four Xeon Platinum 8180M processors cost $52,044, four times as much as the AMD chips.\n\n&gt; Nonetheless, the dual Epyc system racked up single- and multi-core scores of 4,876 and 193,554 points, respectively, while the quad Xeon Platinum 8180M system scored 4,700 and 155,050 points in the single-core and multi-core tests, respectively."", 'That supercomputer’s performance is driven by Nvidia chips, ARM or not does not make a difference.', ""I don't have the numbers on hand, but I hold some AMD and Nvidia over Intel and JPM over Wells Fargo and all of those were up last I checked.

One of the scariest parts of Navigate on Autopilot is watching it try to take an exit that has two lanes. It will suddenly swerve into the exit and then swerve back and forth as the lane widens before randomly picking a lane (which may not be the correct lane) while driving way too fast for the exit.\n\nAll of those are things Waymo has been able to do for over a decade...and before you go ""but HD mapping!""

Waiting for a market crash?"", ""This is a post from u//Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. Should give you an idea of what they've been up to\n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both."", 'They have a fantastic CEO who understands the market and the game. Under her lead company has gone from 2.5$ per share in 2014 to 68$ today. \n\nThey just surpassed Intel in tech and Intel just fucked up their 7nm so Intel will be left in the dust for the next few years. AMD is taking a bigger portion of the server market and consumer market every year and for first time in years the gaming community at large is thinking of going for an AMD setup next time they upgrade. \n\nThey are catching fast up with Nvidia in terms of graphics card capabilities which is their second-largest competitor. They signed both Playstation and Xbox with their next-generation consoles, which is a huge indicator that they can provide both better price and technology compared to competitors.', ""Have around $1,700 freed up to invest.

2020-07-28,"['Prefacing this with mentioning that I don\'t hold AMD, Nvidia, or Intel, but am a hardware enthusiast/work in two research labs that have beefy servers for very intensive scientific computing purposes (granted n=2 here lol) \n\nAMD hasn\'t left Intel in the dust just yet. One of my labs is building a new server, and the standard for high-core count server-grade computing is still Intel by a good chunk -- we\'ve used Xeons in the past and we\'re sticking to Xeons. That said, we\'re also in an upgrade cycle for personal machines, and the majority of the hardcore Arch-using Unix-beard types have shifted to Threadrippers for their workstations. Everyone I know still uses Intel-based machines for their laptops. That said, in the next few years, AMD definitely has potential to do better. It\'s also worth noting that, while Su is a great CEO, AMD success arguably has more to do with Jim Keller (who recently just left Intel after barely a year for ""personal reasons"", following a while at Tesla and, prior to that, a stint at AMD where he more or less invented the Zen architecture). He was also responsible for AMD\'s success in the late 90s/early 2000s (though left for Apple to work on mobile chipsets).  If you compare AMD stock price to Keller’s time there and shift it back by a year or so, there’s a shocking alignment. Industry standards/attitudes towards companies are generally slow to change.\n\nNvidia is eons ahead of AMD graphics (especially for all of the big boy products like the Tesla/Ampere line). Radeon Instinct was (is?) a complete joke compared to K series Tesla GPUs. If memory serves, the best Instinct has similar TFLOPS to an RTX 2080 Ti at FP32. The former isn\'t even purchasable by consumers, but you can have a 2 day delivery of the latter on Amazon. I can\'t comment on anything other than the academia I\'ve been exposed to, but CUDA is everywhere and I can\'t name one paper that uses ROCm or OpenCL. The big DL library support for AMD stuff is terrible.\n\nYour biggest misconceptions have to do with where AMD gets their money, where the potential areas for growth are, and the potential growth within each area.

The issue the announcement highlighted was in manufacturing technology, the area where Intel has been falling behind compared to the now industry leader in TSMC.\n\nWhat makes this tricky though is that Intel is a bit unique in that they are a chip designer as well as a manufacture, but they also essentially only manufacturer for themselves (3rd party is very limited). This is different than others such as AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc. which all employ 3rd parties to manufacture their chips. \n\nIf you hypothetically put up barriers against foreign manufactures, the 2 main options really being TSMC (Taiwan) and Samsung (South Korea), which also are based in US ally nations (and really client states), you'd also hurt all the other US chip designers that are not Intel but are competitors. It'd also be much trickier to rally broad support among western allies as well due to where the companies are based (eg. no easy China scare). \n\nThe competitors also know to play the political angle as well with TSMC for example recently making strides to put infrastructure in the US. \n\nJust for further information there is another independent manufacturer in the US in Globalfoundries (although you could argue foreign owned, Abu Dhabi).

Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers.

TSM is the top holding at 15% but SMH also has a big position in Nvidia, Intel, AMD, etc. And the expense ratio is actually fairly decent at 0.35%.', 'I picked up a small position a few days ago after the drop. It\'s down since then. You\'re welcome.\n\nI did a quick look at the numbers for Intel and AMD and Nvidia. The growth expected for AMD and Nvidia hasn\'t shown up in the numbers yet. So I\'m curious how this will all play out. Chips have always been a very competitive business. And how does it play out if/when Intel farms out manufacturing to Taiwan like all the others? They all are basically design shops that send the making elsewhere. Is this good or bad, not sure.\n\nAnd what is the future of chips? Will our machines become dumb terminals and only need ARM because all the processing is done in the cloud? How will autonomous vehicles and such impact all this? We\'re only going to have more devices in the future that need chips of some sort. Think of how many billions of people still don\'t have ""computers"". One day they will.\n\nThat said we have tremendous amounts of wasted processing power sitting on our idle machines. I see the cloud becoming the modern mainframe and we all subscribe to services as needed. I honestly think Windows will become a cloud service. We\'ll all subscribe to a VM with whatever build we need. Our local machines will be nothing more than dumb terminals to pick up the screen feed. The cloud servers will do all the work. This is what will fundamentally change the chip market.\n\nSo much of what we buy today has a chip of some sort in it. That\'s only going to multiply. And no one maker will be able to do it all. There is plenty of room for competition. I can\'t imagine any one company can win everything. Few industries have ever seen that. I see the big players specializing in one or two things, doing reasonably well in others. The question is really how much investment will it take to keep up? All of these companies have smart people and they are all doing good things. Things will ebb and flow, just like with most industries, but ultimately I see them all winning in their own ways. So what\'s the right price for any of them?', ""Individual Account\n\n**MFs**\n\nFBGRX\n\nFSELX\n\nVFIAX\n\n**ETFs**\n\nBLOK\n\nDIVO\n\nIBB\n\nSOXX\n\nSWAN\n\nVGT\n\nVUG\n\nVXF\n\nWCLD\n\n**STOCKS**\n\nANET\n\nASML\n\nATVI\n\nAYX\n\nCGNX\n\nCRWD\n\nGMED\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nVRTX\n\nWEX\n\nWST  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking a glance!

So many people have missed out on huge gains just because the had a bad feeling.', ""I'll keep posting this until people understand that AMD's rise is deserved. \n\nThis is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. \n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both."", ""Honestly same. I saw it slowly increasing like it has over the past 5 years.

By their own judgement, many airlines won't be back to pre-pandemic passenger levels for 2-4 years. They have taken HUGE losses and mountains of debt. If the 2nd wave is bad and stops air travel again, many will go bankrupt. Virgin Atlantic just warned that they are running out of money.\n\nPlus in addition to this, we don't yet know if people want to take back to the skies.

I also know that it is unbalanced, a lot of tech, so please don\'t insult me :-) I\'m open to any suggestion', ""10nm is built on quad patterning lithography. Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.\n\nYour point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.\n\nAs for taking people at face value:\n\n[https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017](https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017)\n\nIntel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016. I don't see anything that would suggest 7nm is anything different.\n\n[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary)\n\nTSMC views Intel and AMD completely differently. It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price&gt; value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.\n\nTLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price. You have to make the decision as to whether you view the drop as justified or not."", ""Here is mine - 38 yrs !!

(I had shit mutual funds until I woke up this year, after realizing that the work I was doing with my dad could be done with my own money too.)\n\nMy dad, however, has turned $170,000 into nearly half a million since this past September, using short options strategies. The idiots on WSB can't accept the truth of the matter, but it's the people selling options that are making all the money. Along with my help, he's developed a strategy of shorting options right ATM, usually covered calls and usually on earnings. HE collects fat premiums, and either gets assigned or doesn't. If not assigned, he just keeps selling calls and might even run the price up a bit for a swing trade esque profit.\n\nThat's in addition to his long accounts that he doesn't touch, in which he's up over 10x since 2010. u/SugarAdamAli has a pretty good list, but I'd add AMD, Facebook, NVDA, and V. AMD especially is going to the moon. Lisa Su is a straight up generational genius and is poised to start eating market share that's incredibly valuable and highly up for grabs. Overall, I think Amazon is the best stock in the world right now though.\n\nWhat I don't agree with u/SugarAdamAli on is that the key is the price. Wrong. There are many keys, and the price is just one of them. If it was all about the price then any company with a high P/E and at an ATH wouldn't be worth buying. AMD has both, and I think is still undervalued. (AMD will be at 500 before 2030, and I think that's conservative.) If there's any 'key,' it's buying good companies and doing it with concentrated amounts.\n\nAlso, diversification is a term that's been beaten to death and people don't understand it anymore. You don't get rich by buying 500 companies which includes Macy's for Christ's sakes. Depending on how much money you have, you buy 10-20 all star companies and keep tabs on their progress.\n\nThe options strategy is another ballgame. There are many ways of approaching it. The best way to sum it up in a few words (even though I could write a book on it, because most people clearly don't understand how and when to use it) is that you never write on companies you wouldn't mind owning. That's a lot different than going straight up long, since going long you only want the companies you have conviction in, the ones you think are going to the moon. With options, I'd write, say, a short ATM put against SBUX, because they're a great company with a solid stock and on an earnings week the premiums will be solid. Oh, and also, you write weeklies. People writing anything longer dated can't do math, and apparently that's most people.""]"

Plus they have all the capital in the world to make a change into any direction. But you hit the nail on the head, they need innovation and better people in their executive positions. That will happen imo but who knows how fast? I personally think intel is a great value right now and have been continually cost averaging into a bigger position while it’s this low. \n\nTime will tell but just go look at companies like AMD and NVDAs p/e and p/b ratios, margins, etc and you’ll see intel is wildly undervalued as a stock compared to their peers.

I think basing everything on fundamentals with this company is not gonna make sense from an evaluation perspective. Here is why about half my portfolio is Tesla.\n\n- Under the hood, they are an ENERGY company. Yes, they happen to produce vehicles. For now. I had an intuition that this was just going to be a fraction of the business and the last earnings call confirmed this. Elon predicts Tesla Energy is going to be bigger than Tesla Automotive and I have no reason to believe otherwise. It actually makes a lot of sense. Everyone essentially becomes their own utility and you can actually make money by selling to the power grid. This of course requires them to reach the user threshold but with the way Tesla Energy is scaling and profiting, it very well could happen sooner than later.\n\n- The goal is eventually fewer people actually buy Teslas and just use the robotaxi service. That is going to be one of the bigger parts of this. That alongside Tesla Insurance is going to make a very vertically integrated company. There will be more news on the insurance portion in the next earning call. \n\n- I know this has been said a billion times, but I think it's worth to restate. Tesla is not an automotive company. They are a tech company that has an excellent grasp on energy. They produce products that make the most sense to consume electric power (cars, home utility systems, power grids, etc). \n\n- They also product THE BEST autonomous driving technology. They produce chips that outperform NVDA chipsets by a factor of at least 20 at 80% the cost. This is going to be an important facet as they increase the number of vehicles on the road and approach FSD.\n\n- They are also going to be the first to market with FSD and the estimations are pointing to end of 2020. I am aware of WAYMO however their current operations are way more on rails than how Tesla has approached it.\n\n- There will be competition but the similarities end on the aesthetics. I think within the next 3-5 years, companies who aggressively pursue EV will be able to get close (enough in their standard) to Tesla in terms of battery efficiency. Assuming they don't just license Tesla technology (which will happen to the players too far behind). What no one in this decade will catch up-to, is their autonomous driving tech. Their data is collecting at an accelerated rate and no one else is investing as aggressively as Tesla. The only feasible competitor in this sector will be Google. Data is king when it comes to FSD.\n\nNow I will play the other side and say yes, it is possible they crash. It's definitely not impossible. The next 3-5 years of their growth is going to determine that. \n\nI still recommend having some exposure to TSLA. If people feel uncomfortable with buying their shares, you can use the ARKK etf. It has a lot of great stocks in there that focus on disruptive growth. I am buying more TSLA shares as we approach the stock split. I am very excited about their future and where Elon will push it. I have no serious reason to doubt their proven abilities.\n\nWith all that said (thanks for sticking around for my rant), I personally believe TSLA is going to be the biggest company on the planet (solar system? lol) within the decade. They are going to enter and dominate so many different industries that relate to energy (which is a lot) it will not make sense. It will happen faster than people realize and part of this is priced in. 1800~ is their current share price and I think that is a deal for what the stock will be worth 5-10 years from now. I genuinely believe this will sell for 6000+ minimum.

Intel has been trying to get their foot in the GPU market. Their efforts have been pretty lackluster and don’t look too great for the future. If navi can do to nvidia what ryzen did to intel, I could see that growth becoming a lot more than theoretical. \n\nAlso, the new tech going into consoles later this year suggests the future of computing will involve reducing the number of individual components in the system to reduce the latency. This is achieved by integrating these components on to the same die. Modern APUs are showing us that the need for standalone GPUs may be non existent in the near future giving AMD a big advantage in the consumer market. Assuming this, companies in the server industry or AI could just deal with AMD instead of both Intel and Nvidia for their needs. \n\nI do however see your point with Intel.

But right or wrong I am buying or not based on the company and not on the trends.\n\nAmazon was a company that I sold several years back because they couldn\'t show that they knew how to turn a profit.

However intel has been in some rocky water with chips recently which points to XLNX doing better. NVDA is another one, but XLNX has specialized in the FPGAs or Field Programmable Gate Arrays and really taken that as their niche. \n\nThe most exciting thing about that is that a lot of electrical engineer journals i read while researching the company stated that there has been no perfect fit for FPGAs yet. What tends to happen is that FPGAs, due to their built in flexibility, are not the optimal piece to use for the final product created by the end user. Generally, the end user can find some other chip that performs the job at a slightly more efficient clip at the end of the production cycle of the product.\n\nWhy is that exciting? Well in those same electrical engineering journals they stated that VR and AI may be the best fits for FPGAs, because those technologies need to constantly adapt to their environment and change specifications (especially AI because of machine learning characteristics). Essentially, I see XLNX as a good bet for 5G, which is inevitable, a good bet for automated vehicles, which isn’t too far off, and a good bet for VR and AI, which may never happen. If they do though, XLNX could stand to profit a ton.', 'Sold mine today and everyone things I am crazy. Used the $ to buy NVDA.']"

Intel and AMD are using the “outdated” x86 architecture that has scalability problems. AMD has a few tricks up their sleeves that allows them to stay cheap, have larger yields, and more scalability than Intel so their architecture will last longer. \n\nARM is why your phone is so powerful.. uses little energy, small, and packs a big punch. \n\nApple is rolling out their own ARM based chips in their next macbook launch. \n\nNvidia, Apple, and AMD are going to be exciting to watch in the next few years solely on the hardware they release. Stocks will be a different story. Competition and innovation will be the limiting factor.  \n\nNvidia and AMD are 100% buys for me. \n\nI don’t agree with some of Apple’s ideologies and business practices. We’ll see what happens with the likely supreme court level lawsuit from Epic Games for monopoly-like practices.', ""x86 Patent - Despite all the Arm misinformation out there about being comparable to x86, it's not.\n\nThe argument is the same as it was for AMD 4 years ago against Intel. If you control 90% of the HPC and 70% of the GPU markets you have that much to potentially lose if the competitor catches up. AMD is far and away less behind on GPUs in performance per watt than it was in CPU's. There is also the technical factor of knowing if they crack multi-chip GPU's as they did with CPU's they could run away with performance and cost as Nvidia still uses huge monolithic dies, sound familiar?"", 'Love it was looking in to cathie wood and I do think she is a genius I was actually saving up too get into one of her etfs or nvda was my plan', ""I got back into NVDA a few weeks ago when it dipped to 395, and I'm up \\~25%.

If someone could clear this up for me I'd appreciate it."", 'Ah, I see your confusion. Don\'t take analyst\'s PT seriously. These are 1-year PTs, meaning if the company continues to do what they are doing the PT set by the analyst is the expected value of the company at the time. These are wildly inaccurate, but do have a strong psychological influence over new investors. They can help you set general price trends, but in general are not accurate. \n\nThe key to understanding when people will take profits, no matter what the earnings report says, depends a lot on the overall market. If the market is pushing into new highs (like recently), people question the value or want to lock in better than expected profits. However, if the market is considered undervalued, like it was late March and April, no one was willing to sell, and in spite of poor earnings prices continued to climb. ATH = ""I had better take my gains."", ATL= ""buy the dip!"".\n\nIf you start reading how such and company is doing all these great things, and you can see the utility of what they are doing,  you will also notice a large creep in price as earnings approach. 10-30% is not unusual for highly speculative companies like tech and semiconductors (fintech is also in this category). You can bet that either the day of, or right after, earnings there will be profit taking, particularly if we are at ATHs in the market.\n\nThe reason why this happens is largely dependent on the psychology of expected returns and risk aversion. We have been indoctrinated with the idea that anything over a ~7% gain is beating the market. So if you just rode a 30% gain on the back of NVDA, you will likely want to realize that profit, which is why many people sell - fear of losing the money they just made. \n\nAn easy way to play this is to buy the sell-off dip. I commonly buy shares during the run up, and once the sell-off dips happens (assuming earnings were good, and I think the price is justified) I\'ll buy more shares. Sometimes I\'ll buy calls for a quick day trade.', 'Its already bounced back. NVDA is a great company.', ""Softer Data Center guidance from Nvidia is going to hurt AMD, especially now that they're selling chips to Nvidia...

Nvda and amd will be doubling their revenue and profits by then. If not, Triple. \n\nIntel on the other hand, will not even come close to doubling. They have peaked in terms of revenue and profits . They will not make exponential YoY revenue gains like nvda and amd will. \n\nThat is why intels share price actio is dogshit for the past half decade. Investors have piled into amd and nvda for a reason. They both have a higher ceiling,  by a mile.', 'Watch the run up before earnings. NVDA ran pretty good leading up to earnings, making it ""priced in"". After the positive earnings, people took profits, as expected. This is not a bad time to pick up some shares (I did). The price has since been climbing back up. This is common behavior in the market, and it is easy to profit from.', '&gt;do you think AMD has room to grow?\n\nYes. And they should better, given their current P/E.\n\n&gt;How much of Intel\'s pie can they take? I mean, they surely will dominate retail, but what about corporates?\n\nI think they may be able to reach 50% consumer market share in the next 3-5 years, but only if Intel does absolutely nothing, which is not the case. So, I think any prediction 2022 onwards is extremely difficult. Also, if AMD really nail it, they may get 20% datacenter market share in the next 3-5 years.\n\nI haven\'t done real math on this, but from a first estimate, those numbers would still put AMD on a P/E of 40(?)\n\n&gt;Do you believe it pops 100 USD in one year time?\n\nMaybe even this year. AMD\'s stock price imho has nothing to do with their performance as a company. It\'s a meme stock. Very few buyers think about the EPS, make an analysis based on market share AMD may get, take past and projected future growth into account, and afterwards come to the conclusion that AMD is undervalued right now. People drive the price because of FOMO, because they want to be part of the story and because they hear that 7nm &lt; 10nm. Also, ""INTC boring, and NVDA shares cost 480 bucks, I can get 6xAMD for that money, better buy AMD, more shares better, right?"".', ""Yea, but I mean NVDA is LIGHT YEARS behind AMD, I don't know how they would catch up easily..\n\nI believe that NVDA will be dominant in mid to high-end GPUs for years to come.\n\nAMD will be dominant in low-end GPU/CPUs, mid end CPUs and possibly high-end CPUs?\n\nDo you agree?"", 'What’s the barrier to entry for NVDA in CPU?

Just look at the consoles for the evidence (they use custom AMD RDNA 2 GPUs and are surprisingly power efficient with surprisingly high clock speeds) and the rumours pointing to Nvidia's new cards being extremely power hungry, there's a reason for this."", 'I\'m just a casual, but here\'s my broad take.. The industry is broadly categorized between semiconductors (71 listed companies) and semiconductor equipment (ie making the machines used to make the chips, 38 listed companies). It covers a wide range of technologies-- analog chips, processors, network equipment, LEDs, etc.-- and generally companies need to have their niche in the global supply chain in order to have an advantage. This is because the supply chain from silicon wafer to finished product is too complex to completely vertically integrated. You can\'t be a foundry, equipment designer/maker, and chip designer/maker all at the same time efficiently. Also, your equipment maker can also potentially sell the manufacturing equipment to your competitors. In fact, many offer ""turn key"" solutions-- just give us the cash and the space, and we\'ll set up the whole factory for you! So the companies that do well tend to have (or had) an exceptional R&amp;D performance/expenditures to differentiate (AMD, NVDA, TSM today; INTC and IBM in the past). That also makes it a difficult business to maintain an advantage in, since sometimes you just run into an R&amp;D problem and no matter how much money you throw at it the engineers just can\'t come up with a workable solution (eg INTC).', 'Continued data center dominance + widespread ai/machine learning + autonomous tech = NVDA wins big', 'Lam Research, KLA Corp, Skyworks and Nvidia.', ""Intel, Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and Samsung have their own production. The difference between TSMC and the rest is that TSMC is purely production, no own design. They produce for companies like Nvidia and Apple. They are market leaders and have over 50% market share. I'd say these are the 3 largest producers in the semiconductor industry (someone correct me if I'm wrong). I believe that the semiconductor market still has a bright future with self-driving cars, AI and industry 4.0."", '\\&gt;absolutely no one is gonna be looking forward to Nvidias release and spending 2k on a flagship or 1k in the mid tier. \n\nIts not true that there arent people willing to throw whatever money it requires for a 3090, just read /r/hardware.

Nvidia has marketed their raytracing for 2 years now, even changed the product line name for it. If you think raytracing in games you think RTX. The big wave of leaks around Ampere has created a huge hype for it. I dont think its smart of AMD to stay silent about RDNA2. Whats the point of trying to ""surprise"" Nvidia and the rest if everyone already upgraded to Ampere cards? The people who are willing to wait for RDNA2 with their purchase while Ampere is already available is a very small minority. You may have a different impression from browsing hardware related forums, but that\'s not the general market.

Bought them between 1,000.00 and 1,585.00. Then sold 5 and each time I sold one at a time, it was for a loss!

However, the support is terrible; you either have to use reverse engineered drivers that are horrible, or use proprietary firmware blobs that are out of date and under-maintained.  This is not the case for AMD GPUs, where the open source drivers are known to work at least as well as the proprietary drivers. This is because AMD actively develops open source drivers with the community to allow for better support.\n\nAgain, this is a niche position, but I know I am not alone.  If I see a laptop I am interested and see it has an nVidia GPU, I immediately turn away.  I feel really bad for people who want to use Linux but cannot because of the needless stumbling block that comes with getting the nVidia GPUs to work.

Fossil fuels are hated by even the autos.\n2. The U.S. is pumping far more than we thought with the Permian leading the way. We are producing 12 million barrels per day and we are going to 17 million barrels in a few more years, says Scott Sheffield, the\xa0CEO of giant independent Pioneer Natural Resources. We were producing 9 million barrels just two years ago. We have to export so much just to be sure we aren\'t over flowing.\n3. The actual stocks aren\'t showing any lift because they are being so disciplined. We don\'t see companies anymore producing more than they should, given their weak balance sheets. They are too dangerous to own, which means a lot of little oils are uninvestible.\n4. Not only are we now the world\'s largest producer, we produce an immense amount of natural gas but we have no place to put it. We are shipping about six million BCF out of the Louisiana docks. The world loves our liquified natural gas but because of pipe issues, we still don\'t have enough capacity to rid ourselves of the stuff, especially because there isn\'t enough pipe to go to Mexico and the Mexicans seem recalcitrant to accept pipeline natural gas even though they need it, especially propane. That has severely constrained the drilling in the western part of the Permian. No wonder Apache trades where it does.\n5. The mergers that we thought would occur aren\'t occurring. That\'s because Occidental Petroleum paid too much for Anadarko, as we know from the action in OXY\'s stock after it picked up Anardako or Carrizo after its unfathomable merger with Callon Pete.\n6.

Nvidia up to 20 (!) from 10 last year.\n\nTech prices used to be justifiably expensive, but at these levels they are completely decoupled of what the companies are actually earning (including future growth)"", 'Nvidia', 'Lol NVDA is not a ""gaming"" company.', 'Really think this purchase will be highly utilized in the data center sector should check out the A100 gpu made by them watch the ampere videos that Nvidia CEO Jensen released made from a few months back shows a good heap of information on how Nvidia plans to become a huge data driven company', 'NVDA and ENPH', 'I\'ll start by saying you should use no more than 40-50% of your portfolio doing this. You need to be straight up long to take advantage of the monster days in the market.\n\nThe basic idea is to write calls and puts ATM, or to write calls with higher premiums a bit OTM to run up some profit. Obviously, you never write an option below the price you bought at or were assigned at, unless the stock has been damaged enough that you\'re confident it won\'t recover to a certain point at a certain time. \n\nPeople have misconceptions about this.\n\nMisconceptions:\n\n1. **Writing options is risky:** Wrong. It\'s literally no different than going long. Instead, you\'re just also collecting a premium for your troubles. The only risk here is singling out certain tickers that might not recover for some time. Hence the reason you need $100k or more: to be able to diversify your positions enough that you\'re not bagholding on the majority of them.\n2. **Avoid volatile stocks:** My god, this one is the most ridiculous of them all. The only reason--and I mean ONLY REASON--that you would avoid volatile tickers is because you\'re emotional. Volatile stocks pay higher premiums. Volatile stocks allow you to write on them at big discounts. Volatile stocks might run up before you sell the call, or allow you to collect decent premiums at higher strikes. I\'ve seen people list stocks like Apple, NVDA, Facebook, AMD and Netflix as stocks to avoid when writing options. These are literally the very stocks that made us the most money. Volatility means absolutely nothing if the companies are good, and these companies are much more than good.\n3. **What if the market tanks:** Okay? So...what? People cite some quote about picking up pennies on a train track, when that was attributed to naked options. If you\'re long anyway, then you\'re in no different position. I have absolutely no idea why this is cited as a reason to avoid writing options. This, mathematically, makes absolutely no sense, and you cannot prove me wrong.\n4. **Long dated options:** Stop. Just stop. If you\'re not writing weeklies, you have no idea what you\'re doing. Again, math: the premiums are higher (yes, they are higher, do the math); you can better aim your strikes; and you don\'t have to sit there for months on end biting your nails as the market does what it does.\n5. **The object is to make as much premium as possible without my shares being assigned:** Huh? This isn\'t a long strategy. This is an options strategy; the whole idea is to make outsized weekly gains, between 1-4%. Any capital gains are bonus (though they can be big as well in certain cases). If you\'re trying to juggle going long with an options strategy, you\'re just caught in no-man\'s land.\n6. **Writing options is a neutral to bearish strategy:** Again, why would you listen to your brokerage\'s tutorial on options trading? Writing calls and puts works in literally any market, except for a crash, in which the only good strategy is shorting, and good luck to you on that one.\n7. **Avoid writing on stocks reporting earnings:** Huh? Again, emotions over logic. Why do I care if my shares get called away because Apple mooned at earnings? If I\'m making 3-4% on premium--IN ONE WEEK--why am I getting the FOMOs? Why are you dumping Amazon because it fell 4% after earnings? Why aren\'t you instead selling another call at the price you bought? Stop shooting yourself in the foot.\n8. **You will miss out on dividends:** This might be the dumbest of them all. When I\'m collecting 1-4% weekly, do you think I give two \\*hits about dividends? We once executed a daily SPY put at near the market bottom in March that netted over 500% annualized. And you\'re bringing up *dividends*?\n9. **Taxes:** So you have to pay taxes on money you make. Would you rather not make money? Okay then what are we talking about? Also, you can use your IRA if you have enough in there. Enough said.\n\nHere\'s a brief overview of the strategy. You pick stocks you really like, and then you check earnings each week. Do a good balance of quality stocks and quality stocks reporting earnings, since the premiums are huge.\n\n1. You sell WEEKLY ATM calls or cash secured puts. If you\'re a little twitchy about the market, sell puts a little further out of the money. Let\'s say you sell 15 contracts. Two of them dip. You\'ve made 3-4% in a week, so just sell cheaper calls at a strike equal to the cost of the shares. Now you can do it all over again with the shares that got assigned (or didn\'t if the price was flat or you sold a put). You might make slightly less this week, but with the constant gains, 1-4% per week is going to constantly increase.\n2. Now, for the stocks that you\'re stuck with, get creative--but be PATIENT. I recently wrote a put on BAC at 28.50. Not my best move, but now I\'m waiting, looking to sell longer dated calls. ""Wait, but you just told us to do weeklies."" With the stocks that are down, not necessarily. That\'s the beauty of the strategy. If you go long on BAC at 28.50 and don\'t sell anything, you\'re shit out of luck until it recovers. At least you can sell a call. Every day I look at what a 28 call with a month to expiration would net me. ""Wait, but you said to write only at the price you bought it at."" Well, I\'ve already made $50 on the stock, and plus, I don\'t think it\'s going to fully recover in a month. Now it\'s at 26.11, and I can start looking at decent premiums. If they get taken away, fine, I broke even on that one. But for every time that happens, far more often I\'ll be down on a stock for long enough that I sell enough calls to still make a decent 1-30% annualized profit by the time it\'s called away.\n3. As for choosing stocks, go with what\'s good. It\'s as simple as that. Would you buy Apple? Starbucks? eBay? Verizon? Great, then if it\'s a good time, such as earnings season or the stock is at a discount, go ahead with it. I like to look at the 52 week highs. It\'s great to buy stocks at a discount, ESPECIALLY when you\'ve written on that stock before. I can\'t tell you how many contracts we\'ve written on Apple. It\'s near a thousand by now. Same with NVDA and Netflix. We\'re aggressive, because we\'re emotionless. As I said before, volatility means absolutely nothing when writing options. It\'s your emotions. If NVDA drops 20%, fine, I don\'t care. It\'s a great stock, and at least I collected a premium. I\'d happily go long NVDA, and in that case I wouldn\'t be making anything. I can\'t tell you how many times we\'ve bought these stocks at discounts because you fools make the price fluctuate. Probably 30% of our profits are riding stocks back up and past where they were, then writing on them again when they fall again.  \nAs for choosing stocks with earnings coming out, the rules are no different; don\'t write a put on Nikola because the premiums are fat. I.e. don\'t be an idiot. But it\'s also about the price. My worst move ever was writing a put on WORK before the past earnings release. I like Slack, it\'s early but I think they\'re doing big things. But I sold the put during a run-up prior to earnings. Stupid. Now I\'m holding the bag. HOWEVER, as proof of how great this strat is, though I sold the put at 38 strike, I\'m writing long dated calls at 32. Why? Because I\'ve already made over $600 writing on that stock. I literally can\'t lose. Same with Marriott. I wrote so many puts that, after writing one at 111, I could write at less than 90 and still come out even. I won\'t, because I know it\'s going to pump after the vaccine announcement, and it\'s still incredibly undervalued, but again, just another example of how even the losers turn out to be winners if you just run the numbers.\n4. Speaking of running the numbers, it all comes down to math. You write down the price you bought at and/or the strike you sold at. You write down the premium. Then you write down the profit and add to the premium (the difference between the price you bought and the call strike). Recently, I wrote a TMUS put at 108 prior to earnings. It pumped to 116 after--but I made $275. Do you think I give a poop what I \'missed out on\' when I just made over 2.5% in one week? Multiple that by 52 weeks and what do you get? And yes, this is consistently reached. Last week we made nearly $8,000. Last month--over $30,000.\n\nAfter a few years, when I can include a longer-dated bear market that obviously won\'t provide as good of returns, I\'d like to eventually try and manualize the strat. A lot of it is about temperament. \n\nOne final note. $100,000 really is a baseline, and even then I think you\'re a little less flexible than you ought to be. You need to be able to ride out four or five stocks that have dipped, so that you can still write ten or twenty new contracts every week and maintain the cash flow stream.', 'Lol clearly you don’t buddy. You just shut down an idea before even hearing about it. You react emotionally. A thousand others like you have tried to dispel what’s been tangibly working, and which, like I said, requires no more risk than going long in stocks you believe in. You’re honestly a joke, and your insecurity is transparent.\n\nSo I’ll ask you this: if I made 10x since I started in 2006, and then started a short derivatives strategy last year and have turned 170,000 into 470,000 while only adding another 80 or so, pray tell, what am I missing? Are you not invested in Apple? Microsoft? NVDA? Am I ‘picking up pennies in front of a steamroller?’ Well if so, then so are you.', ""I'm a complete noob but I would put amd in my retirement portfolio, not so much nflx. Amd is comparable to nvda and as for growth idk what nflx can do besides streaming."", 'Holding my trusty 1 share of NVDA forever!']"
