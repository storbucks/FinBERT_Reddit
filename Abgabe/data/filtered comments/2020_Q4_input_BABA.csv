This fund is a capitalization weighted, non-leveraged passively managed real estate ETF with a benchmark of MSCI US IMI Real Estate 25/50 Index. It\'s not one that gets mentioned on here a lot. Like all Real Estate investments, it took a hit in March and is slow to recover.  \n\nThe fund scores a perfect 10.0 out of 10 analyst rating from XTF. If you are going to hold Real Estate in an ETF, this is the one to have. It may take several months or even a few years for Real Estate to recover, so as long as you aren\'t expecting immediate returns, this fund is (hopefully) a solid long term hold. The fund has a distribution yield of a very respectable 3.8% and should sustain that distribution for the foreseeable future. \n\nYou have almost 12% of your portfolio in this fund, and that seems about right to me.\n\n**VTI** \\- Vanguard IDX Fund. **VTI** is a Capitalization-weighted, non-leveraged, passively managed equity ETF with the benchmark index of CRSP US Total Market Index.  Over the long term, the fund performs somewhat similarly to the S&amp;P 500 index. It has the same companies as the top 6 holdings but in different percentages.  \n\nWhile I personally think a fund that is more top-heavy with the FAANG stocks would perform better over the long haul, this is a solid choice and provides great diversification, with perhaps slightly less volatility than a more tech-heavy fund would have. **VTI** is a favorite of many people on this subreddit and it\'s hard to argue against it for a broad market fund.  It has a solid 9.7/10 analyst rating.\n\nFor a 22 year old, my suggestion would be to put some money into **QQQ** which should provide more long-term growth than **VTI**. However, you wouldn\'t have to stop investing in **VTI**. You could just take what you are putting here and split it between the two. There would be a lot of duplication by doing that, but I think your portfolio would grow more quickly if you do that.  (I\'m not a financial expert and this isn\'t financial advice; just something to consider). \n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund.  I\'m not very fond of Total Stock funds, especially International ones. They tend to underperform the S&amp;P 500 Index and if you\'re going to pick a very broad market fund, why not just pick **VOO** or **SPY**?  \n\nHowever, this fund may be the exception to my dislike of international funds.  The top holdings include **BABA**, Tencent Holdings, Nestle SA, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Roche Holding, Novartis, SAP, Toyota, and ASML. If I were going to invest in a handful of non-US companies, these would all be solid choices. I would not be surprised if this fund performs at least as well as, if not better than the S&amp;P 500 index over the next few/several years.  It has a 9.8/10 Analyst rating from XTF. \n\n**JPM** \\- JPMorgan Chase is one of the few bank stocks that I own. Like all bank stocks, it took a beating in March and is still trying to recover. It\'s a little early to tell how the unemployment rate and bankruptcies are going to affect the banking industry over the next several months, but if any bank can weather the storm, JPM should be able to. It\'s a bit of a risky stock for that reason, but I think a solid choice for a long-term hold. The Equity Summary Score is slightly bearish on JPM with a rating of  4.5/10. The stock does pay dividends with a respectable 3.57% yield. That should continue.  If I were you, I would continue to put 12% or so of your investment dollars here. Other stocks in this sector include WFC (Wells Fargo), BAC (Bank of America) and TD (Toronto Dominion).\n\n**MSFT** \\- Microsoft is probably one of the best companies to have money in right now. They haven\'t had the same growth in value as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google over the past ten years or so, but I think they are poised to do great things in the future.  I\'m bullish on MSFT and I own shares, myself. Microsoft does pay a small dividend, but nothing to write home about.  Recognia Technical Analysts have given Microsoft a strong Long-term Sentiment and S&amp;P Global Intelligence suggests that it is slightly undervalued. \n\n**BA** \\- Boeing Co.  Here\'s where you and I are going to disagree. Boeing has obviously had issues with their 737 Max. Cancellations are outpacing orders on this ""flagship"" airliner. And now the FAA is looking into issues with the 787.  The Equity Summary Score for Boeing stock is a very bearish 0.3/10, and Recognia Technical Analysts give it a ""weak"" rating for the short term, mid-term and long-term. In fact, looking through the various analyst reports, I don\'t see a single analyst that likes this stock. \n\nBoeing could come back but it could take years or even decades to return to pre-737 Max levels.  This company has fundamental problems beyond decreased air traffic and I wouldn\'t touch this one with a ten foot pole. There are so many better choices out there.  If you want to diversify outside of Tech, consider something like Disney, Coca Cola, Kroger, Pepsi or Best Buy.  Amazon, Google and Apple would also be better choices for 11% of your portfolio.  \n\n**MAR** \\- Marriott. Here is another one that the analysts don\'t like; however, I\'m with you on this one. Of all the Hotel stocks out there, this one is my favorite.  Their properties are mostly in the mid-price to upper-mid range. They are taking a hit due to the pandemic situation and the Analysts are knocking them for that. However, once the COVID situation is over, I think Marriott will bounce back and continue to be a strong, solid-performing company.\n\nThat said, the analysts give this an Equity Summary Score of 0.6/10 (very bearish) and a weak Long-term Sentiment.  (Long term in this context is 9 months to 2 years). However, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence regards the stock as slightly under-valued with a score of 62/100 where 100 is most undervalued and 1 is least undervalued. They also give the stock a very high ""quality"" score (91/100) but rank it only 33/100 for Financial Health.  This last low score is largely due to COVID.  I think Marriott bounces back within a few years and I expect you to see good long-term growth.  (But what do I know?)  Other options in this sector include:  **HLT** (Hilton) and **H** (Hyatt).\n\nThe only advice I would give you is that you may want to diversify into a couple of other sectors.  ETFs might be the best way to do that. \n\nI\'m bullish on renewable/clean energy stocks.  The best ETFs in this sector include:  **ICLN**, **TAN**, **PBW** and **QCLN.** (I have shares in **ICLN**, **TAN** and **PBW**). \n\nI\'m also bullish on some health care ETFs including some that specifically invest in companies on the cusp of Genomic technology.  Look for:  **ARKG**, **IDNA**, **XLV** and **FHLC** in this area. (I have shares in **ARKG** and **XLV**.)\n\nAnother ETF that I\'ve put some money in is **THNQ**. This one invests in companies involved in artificial intelligence and robotics.  Other ETFs in this area include **ROBT**, **ROBO** and **ARKQ**.\n\nI hope this helps. best of luck to you.\n\n*(I\'ll give your portfolio an overall score of A-, which you could raise to an A+ by getting rid of Boeing and adding ICLN and ARKG.)*']"
2020-09-12,"[""BABA. AMZN. Both stocks have growth potential far beyond what their current business model is. Both stocks have been held back, as in having their share values intentionally suppressed, by Trump's attacks. \n\nIf Trump loses the election, for example, the likelihood that Amazon will win its lawsuit against the Trump administration's ramming of the JEDI contract away from Amazon out of political spite over Jeff Bezos' Washington Post anti-Trump reporting, goes way up. Trump has also been making stabs at attacking BABA as well. \n\nThe politically motivated economic cold war vs tech companies owned by people that Trump doesn't like have been suppressing the value of some tech stocks by increasing their risk factors and by keeping retail investors out of them (except for AMZN). The latter is a good thing. It means that their extraordinary value is on solid fundamentals (which is consistent with my analysis) but and that they actually are not inflated.\n\nI've been buying some stocks on dips and not others. In my opinion, the next story for tech growth stocks is one of the stocks separating into tiers. Those with solid fundamentals are poised for a new move up (if the market doesn't crash) or they will have less of a crash/better recovery (if the market crashes). Those who are just floating along on an inflated bubble of retail investors and speculative options activity, are going to deflate or, if they don't, they will drag the rest of the tech sector down eventually. \n\nThe real issue is that some stocks are in a bubble and some are not, due to passive investors buying index funds and investing in sectors without understanding that drivers of growth are very different for different companies.

By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it\'s an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I\'m not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

2020-09-21,"['Ok so you say value investing is profitable. Say you identified a telecom that is valued at 5bn market cap. 500mm profits. So P/E is 10. Other Telecoms are trading 15-20. Assuming no material issues at this company, you identified a value opportunity. \n\nThis fits the value investing principle. However, you don\'t know how the market will value telecoms going forward. They might decline as new start ups eat their market share and replace their business models. Maybe profits shrink due to increased competition or regulation. \n\nSo then you have either lower cash flows in the future or lower premiums (p/e multiple) or both. So even if you found a company that you believe will ""revert to mean"", you can still lose money as the market will reduce the value of both itself and peers, preventing a reversal to mean. If the sector P/E falls to 13, this company\'s P/E could fall to 9. It has closed in the gap, so outperformed peers on a relative basis. But you still lost money. \n\nThats what we have seen over last 10 years as the economic gravity has shifted towards Internet companies, such as apple, fb, Google, amazon, alibaba etc. \n\nImagine the telecom company. You thought it would revert to a sector or historic mean of P/E at say 15. But given economic/sector/company trends, the P/E might decline over time. Hence reversal to mean is in no way guaranteed. In some cases it is betting against disrupters, e.g. buying GM is betting against Tesla and buying a retail company on the cheap is betting against Amazon. \n\nKeep in mind that typically stock market index performances are driven by a very small % of companies (e.g. 4% I read last time). That means 96% might underperform the index over the LT. In other words, betting on mean reversal isn\'t necessarily backed by empirical evidence and is also a bet against disruption, which in the time of maturing Internet based business models can be a very dangerous thing to do.', 'take a look at shake shack, and some Chinese companies like alibaba', 'you guys dont care that baba is just an offshore holding company and not the real company']"

XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM**  \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors.  This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan.  This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds.

Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nOther sector funds that I like include:\n\n**Health Care:**  FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:**  IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:**  IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:**  ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:**  BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n*I\'m not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

BABA will continue to grow because its current demonstrated leadership culture gives it strong capability as an innovator, the business environment in China supports growth because they don\'t have monopolies squatting on entire industries and blocking competition (the problem we have here in the US with some of our tech companies that Congress is having hearings over), and because the underlying economy that supports the business and provides spending income to BABA\'s customers is growing fast. BABA will hit whatever target you can think of as being relevant this year, and then pass it.\n\nYou can hold onto BABA for years and its value will grow unless the Chinese economy crashes or the company itself falls apart due to some phenomenon that wipes out ecommerce as an industry.\n\nThe reason to sell BABA is when/if you decide you want to put your money into something else that will grow *faster* in the near term.

XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VXUS - Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I\'m also going to include EFA and EEM. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. EFA is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and EEM is rated only 5.7/10. EEM appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. EFA appears to be more tilted toward the European market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VOO/SPY - VOO and SPY are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like QQQ, VTI, VTG, VOOG and SPYG.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWF - This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than VOO/SPY, less volatile than QQQ.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWM - for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ICLN/TAN/FAN - These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARK group of funds: ARKG, ARKF, ARKK ARKW, ARKQ, PRNT and IZRL.

Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A nice portfolio might look something like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - VXUS - International  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10% each in four sector funds of your choice  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hope this helps.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\'m not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.\n\nSolid info, thank you, I\'m cutting and pasting this into a doc for myself.', '&gt;QQQ - This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it\'s an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VXUS - Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I\'m also going to include EFA and EEM. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. EFA is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and EEM is rated only 5.7/10. EEM appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. EFA appears to be more tilted toward the European market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VOO/SPY - VOO and SPY are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like QQQ, VTI, VTG, VOOG and SPYG.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWF - This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn\'t get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than VOO/SPY, less volatile than QQQ.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWM - for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ICLN/TAN/FAN - These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARK group of funds: ARKG, ARKF, ARKK ARKW, ARKQ, PRNT and IZRL. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARKG - Genomic RevolutionARKF - FintechARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligencePRNT - 3D printing technologyIZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XLV - Health CareXLK - TechnologyXLY - Consumer DiscretionaryXLF - FinancialXLU - Utilities  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I\'m adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  WCLD, SKYY, CLOU, BUG and XIKT. Of these WCLD has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in WCLD include ZM, PLAN, CRM, CRWD, ZEN, WDAY, TENB, PCTY, DDOG, BL.  Many of these are likely to also appear in QQQ, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Read through the comments below.

I’m definitely subject to the same psychological investing issues all the time. For example, I waited for months for HEI to recover close to my cost basis and while the stock weathered better than most airlines and it did bounce back somewhat, I could have used that capital to be in something higher growth. In terms of pulling the trigger, I find it helps to realize (in my personal situation) that the difference on any given day is like $200 at most in terms of any given stock pick. The trigger becomes much easier to pull when I realize after it’s done I’ve literally never thought about any of my prior picks and thought “Oh, I should have waited another day”.

With a tight spread since your long leg is very close to your short leg, and when you factor in slippage, it becomes almost non-practical to roll for a credit if your spreads are challenged at all. Another way to look at this, is it's theoretically always possible to roll a naked option for a credit. Wide spreads behave the closest to a naked option, then it would be easier to roll them out for a credit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I'm up 8% on a 10k RH account, no commissions here. I'm new.

I think ICLN is probably an okay hold long-term although it's not a sector I know much about. I try to stay away from energy personally because there's too much political risk.\n\nBeyond that, understanding your goals as an investor will be important in how you construct your portfolio. I consider myself an investor as opposed to a trader, but I do believe certain investments need to be traded rather long-term holds. Names like TSLA for example aren't great as long-term holds because there is too much uncertainty and the price is driven largely by investor sentiment, but if you believe in the company and can get in at a good price then sell when it hits a price target it's not a bad name to own.\n\nI'd argue most stocks shouldn't be considered in a long-term portfolio, even names like AAPL I feel are too risky if you won't be looking at your portfolio for 5 years. If you want buy and hold names, I'd be buying stuff like KO, MSFT and BABA or preferably an index fund.\n\nIf you want to learn how to actively manage your portfolio I think you could consider much more. There's lots of opportunity in beaten down reopening names at the moment. Names like DIS and MGM might be decent names to hold over the next year or two. There are also names like SQ, SHOP, NET, CRWD which I like if you can get in and out of at the right prices.\n\nSo long as you're not making awful investments by far the most important thing is staying invested in the market and continuing to add to your portfolio. If you have a job I'd suggest you deposit a decent percentage of your income into your portfolio. Starting early is by far the best advise for making a lot of money in the market."", ""Tbh I love them picks too it's just the valuations. Why I got arkk.

As a result they heavily filtered it and decided the truck was a static object like an overpass or sign gantry.  Their vision system was dogshit at the time and identified the truck as part of the sky line.  Most of these systems are nowhere near as comprehensive or accurate as you seem to think, they\'re getting better but they\'re probabalistic estimators by design and their thresholds for intervention are closer to 65-70% than 99.999999% and you don\'t even find accuracy numbers that high for basic tasks for object recognition and depth estimation in cutting edge academic research most of the time.  Really that\'s a ridiculous number given that farm simpler tasks with far more complex consensus models don\'t even achieve that kind of accuracy.  For Tesla\'s system specifically they don\'t a vision based depth field estimator currently, train on video data or prestitched panoramas of their camera feed to deal well with objects moving between them.  Their actual highway TACC systems still suffer from problems like phantom breaking and properly detecting static road side obstacles specifically because they lean so heavily on their front radar array which just has terrible vertical resolution.  Their smart summon system is basically a two ton Roomba at this point too.\n\nThey\'re supposed to be doing a big rewrite to actually approach the problem in a sane say instead of everything being bolted onto their radar heavy TACC system but even that they\'re hyping as ""zero intervention"" some of the time.  None of this crap is even the hard stuff though like ascertaining the intent of pedestrians, cyclists and deriving a good structural and semantic understanding of things like intersections or other crossings.\n\nWaymo\'s system should be better specifically because they\'re willing to use additional sensor suites (primarily LIDAR) and HD maps which provide a good expectation for what the ground truth should look like.  Even then it\'s taken them years to get things working in one town in Arizona under close to ideal driving conditions.\n\nMaybe in 5-10 years we see Waymo get things portable enough or do enough mapping to transition their system to a major metro area where they can potentially make money off a robotaxi service in good weather, but that\'s about as optimistic as I\'m willing to be personally.  There\'s also a huge problem here with there being no real formal verification or indepedent testing process for pretty much any FSD system currently let alone a comprehensive regulatory framework that at least provides some assurances of safety, functionality and redundancy.

I have been profiling the industrials bull market that appears to try to leap every time the stimulus package looks hopeful. This week, with its on-again-off-again stimulus revealed some interesting gyrations as money started to flood into industrials and infrastructure from tech and then reversed on Friday. It seems pretty clear to me that, at least this week, most tech stocks are the new gold. I.e. institutionals and hedge funds seem to be storing money in tech waiting to roll it out as soon as the real economy bottoms in the way that they have traditionally used gold or bonds. This is especially reinforced by the fact that gold and tech stock gains are now apparently moving in tandem. That suggests to me that an even bigger set of corrections than what we saw in September (when the Dow Jones industrials caught a lift) are due in tech stocks if a stimulus agreement ever does get locked in. There has been some talk of an industrials bull market and I think that cash is mainly going to come out of tech stocks and gold.\n\nI feel I can prepare to anticipate these large money flow shifts and I'm trying to profile which companies to have ready for a possible industrials bull market rotation. But the ongoing focus on tech stocks is drowning out news for other sectors. \n\nRight now, I'm trying to screen lists of about 200-400 stocks to see which ones are bull-market-worthy and which are just short bounces. \n\nI think I'll try to start up something like a 2020's Industrials Bull Market Stock Picker weekly thread to try to share or keep up with what others are thinking.

Caterpillar (CAT) and Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) are singled out as companies harnessing the powers of data and automation in ways that should make their sales more consistent and their bottom lines more profitable. A shift toward renewable energy and electric vehicles is said to provide the catalyst for companies with electrification technologies like Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR) and Eaton (NYSE:ETN). \n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/industrial-stocks-are-getting-ready-for-10-years-of-outperformance-heres-how-to-play-it-51602280389\n\nIf I could eventually wind up with 4-6 industrials stocks that are the equivalent of BABA to round out my long portfolio and inform my short plays, I'd be ecstatic."", 'I like BABA and JD.

Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I\'m not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren\'t diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.

Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don\'t like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don\'t tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don\'t mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap.

The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn\'t be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in ""disruptive,"" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund.

I do own shares in many of the funds I\'ve listed above.*', 'I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I\'m not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren\'t diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&amp;P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don\'t like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don\'t tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don\'t mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)\n\n**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn\'t be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in ""disruptive,"" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.

Is it “healthy” debt? This would tell you to not buy Ford, since they are 100 billion in debt. But it would tell you that Apple is using their debt for growth, and you’d see that they have tens of billions in cash in case the going gets rough.\n\nWhat is the companies plan to secure future gains? Does it sound fucking stupid? These question would’ve prevented purchasing Nikola, and would push you to buy alibaba for example.\n\nWhere does the company fit in 2025? 2030? This would tell you to not buy GameStop, because who would go to a store when they can just click a button at home. This would also tell you to buy Vale, since you can see that batteries are the future, and that we have a very probably nickel shortage in about 3-4 years.\n\nAlso, ALWAYS be adding outside cash when you can, but not at a rate that you are eating ramen. If you start with 100 like you are, and add 50 a month for the next ten years with standard market growth, you’d make about 2.5 grand on top of your overall 6.1k investment. But if you only did the 100, and then it sat,  you’d only have 180 at the ten year mark. Basically always be adding. \n\nI’d recommend, if the money is burning a hole in your pocket, just buying something safe like JPM or WM. You can also do fractional shares too.\n\nThe most essential thing thought: HAVE A GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING PLAN. Not having a plan is how you end up YOLOing your entire portfolio into a meme-tier option purchase and then end up negative 400 dollars. Follow sound investing advice, even if it’s “slow”. Buy those lame ETFs and index funds, ball hard on 3M and Johnson and Johnson. Get your portfolio to where you have a comma in your yearly dividends.

KWEB isn't going to acquire ANT stock until 10 days after the IPO launch (I called Kraneshares this morning and asked).\n\nI did buy some KWEB shares this morning, and it is also rising (less than BABA stock is) because it holds BABA stock and BABA is rising this morning. So KWEB will own some ANT in 2 ways: indirectly through BABA and also 10 days after the IPO, KWEB will directly hold some ANT shares. But insofar as BABA stock is rising, KWEB would also be more expensive if I waited until 10 days after the IPO to buy some KWEB.\n\nI'm still wondering about whether that was a good choice vs buying just more BABA stock because BABA owns 32% of ANT anyways.

Right after I liquidated 8% of my holdings, everything tanked, so I've been sitting on extra cash all week. I'm putting about 0.25% stakes into about 15 or 20 of them (I lost count), and I'll re-evaluate in a couple weeks which to keep and liquidate the losers to DCA into the keepers. \n\nThis combined with existing holdings puts my value/reopening plays somewhere around 12% , with much bigger stakes in the growth powerhouses (BABA alone is nearly 20%), Chinese EV market, and clean energy."", 'Disclaimer: I\'m new to investing and am neither investing a lot right now or making crazy gains, lol. I\'m watching and learning more than anything. This is my opinion.\n\nYou bought into tech, especially meme stocks. Amazon, Tesla etc have been doing amazingly well and they generate a lot of positive buzz so even without DD you hopped on the train and made some money. These companies represent a small portion of all the companies available in the market. Right now these companies are driving the market. So yes you can go in and out and make money on them. Do the valuations make sense? Maybe and maybe not. \n\nNobody knows how long this run will last or where the top is. Everyone wants to find the ""next big thing"". \n\nAs other poster\'s have said, other companies went up by even larger percentages... finding these require DD, some luck, and more work than following the crowd. I\'m new to investing and am watching more than anything... these are things I don\'t hear about until they\'ve already run up and made news because of it.\n\nMany other companies that are not in tech, or are generally stable picks but don\'t have this high positive sentiment behind them and are not making huge gains, or have been good holds but are now struggling hugely during this pandemic, or... or... or...\n\nSo why is it uncommon to gain 20-30%? That would be because the market is not just appl, tesla, baba... and even on those you\'re making those large gains now not years ago.\n\nNobody has a crystal ball telling them what will happen when. Nobody knows for sure what will explode or how, where the bottom is or what\'s a ""good price"" to jump in on, how much money to invest into whatever stocks or whether a ""better"" choice is just around the corner. \n\nPeople study different sectors and company performances to make the best choices they can and it\'s still no guarantee that that choice will perform. One bad choice or the wrong timing can and does wipe people out.\n\nSo congrats on your gains but if you\'re following the herd it\'s more luck than anything that you\'re riding on. Don\'t think for a second that the current market conditions are common or that this one little sample in history of this one little sample of the market is common.', 'Your right, it’s so simple let’s all only invest in Amazon, Tesla, baba, etc, then we’ll all get massive returns!!!', 'Moderna and Google, plus a couple of my speculation plays in healthcare and real estate are doing well today. \n\nNIO, CRSP, BABA, and clean energy are telling me to gtfo.', ""I sure hope it does too!

So, I'll stick with BABA until then!"", 'One day my free brokerage account will have access to international exchanges. One day. I expect good things for my BABA shares in the meantime.', 'nice point on the IPO buuuuut i searched and found that BABA listing in HK never dipped below the IPO price as compared to its US listing.

I might just jump right in.. if it dips; oh well il just buy more', 'Just buy baba and you have exposure to a lot more than just ant', ""BABA might rise on sympathy? This would be interesting to watch.\n\nAlso BABA has been performing much better in the last week and half where the market was not doing too great.

Unless we decide to do a real 1-2 month shutdown, I expect this will be a drag on the economy for at least a year.  \n\nI think that the tradition of the US Market always going up in the long-term has relied on the benefits of being the world economic leader and banker.  \n\nPersonally, I wish I was still working in China, and wish more of my money was there too. So, I started buying into mutual funds, mostly China Small Business funds and Asia Emerging Markets funds.  \n\nWhen I look at the holdings, I don't buy when I see NYSE stocks.

BABA has pulled back over the last hour as well."", 'STNE BABA', ""I run a small fund with &gt;10% in BABA. The appeal of BABA lies in its long-term centrism of their ecosystem. Jack Ma claimed that it is built to last for 102 years. This long-term focus is immensely valuable to shareholders; as opposed to the typical management in the U.S. who are obsessed with quarterly earnings and attempts to impress wall street by the quarter. \n\nWhile investors typically compare BABA with AMZN/ [JD.com](https://JD.com), they have different business models. AMZN and JD attempt to compete their competitors away while BABA attempts to empower merchants and businesses, such that they become reliant on BABA's ecosystem. BABA influences more than 55% of the Chinese e-commerce space while AMZN only 30+% and declining. Considering their reach (ecosystem), their profit margins, and cash flow generation capabilities, it is difficult to justify the huge difference in their valuation. \n\nIgnoring the noise surrounding the delisting/ US-China trade war, I believe that the long-term risk lies in the execution risk of the management. Will they be able to stay focus on the core businesses and enhance their ecosystem or be distracted by other ventures due to complacency? Can they maintain their relationship with the govt and the regulators without overstepping their boundaries? \n\nCapital allocation abilities may be a concern after BABA matures, but this may take another 10 years. Considering that it is growing at baseline 20-30% per annum and trading at a fair multiple, the execution risk should be well compensated by a v reasonable market price."", ""PINS has execution AND strategy all rolled in to one.

What happens later in the day, after the dive levels off, depends on a few things. It might rally right away if people want to pile into it, but then it might not if people who want to build big stakes in it already have the positions they want. We've had plenty of time to build up positions in BABA so a lot of people don't have to buy more today.

He spoke after bigwigs including Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, and Yi Gang, the central bank governor.\n\n&gt; “Our next speaker needs little introduction,” the host said. “He says he came to the Bund Summit today to throw a bomb.”...\n\n&gt; He then proceeded to throw several bombs. He roasted financial regulators for being obsessed with minimizing risk, even though, he said, “there is no innovation in this world without risk.” He accused China’s banks of behaving like “pawnshops” by lending only to those who could put up collateral.\n\nPeople in China don\'t doubt that he intended to attack the regulation of fintech. Or that he acted like an ass:\n\n&gt; One wag on social media called Mr. Ma’s remarks in Shanghai “the most expensive speech in history.”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/technology/china-ant-group-ipo.html\n\nBut I think the thing to recognize here, that makes all the difference in my assessment, is that China\'s fintech empires were making money hand over fist in an an area of finance in China that was being largely ignored, and there wasn\'t a lot of control over how much money was being lent in loans that were backed with nothing and being resold as securities. When the value of those businesses start amounting to trillions, as the ANT IPO demonstrated, that\'s a big systemic risk to society. So not a lot of people are arguing that regulation was uncalled-for or unnecessary.\n\nJack Ma blew up the IPO because he was trying to lead an insurrection against regulation that would limit the value of ANT, but that was needed, and the way he chose to defy authority speaks to his own inability to compromise or work within a system of financially responsible constraints.  I also wonder what the businesses are doing if he has so much problem with oversight and regulation. \n\nThis disaster says more about Jack Ma\'s lack of judgment and defiant egotism than the CCP. I don\'t trust his personal judgment anymore and while I think that BABA is a great business and has a great future, I don\'t think that it has as much potential as I thought last week. To me, I need to see how much the company is worth after the halo of ""exceptionalism in leadership"" factor fades and Americans realize what an intemperate jerk he is, before I\'ll allocate more than a few percent to BABA and its related businesses again. \n\nJack Ma threw a temper tantrum to try to leverage his fame and epic IPO to escape regulation instead of working responsibly with the government on regulation that is overdue for China\'s fintech businesses. He fucked over everyone who had invested money and time into this IPO and I lost money along with a lot of other people. I don\'t forgive him.', 'Ic, can I ask what you mean by change in fundamentals?\n\nAre you saying that ANT IPO, if it gets listed at a lower valuation, it affects the overall value of BABA?', 'I like TSM the best of the three, though BABA is good too.', 'I feel like Xpeng is a better investment than Nio.

I will say, Tesla recently dropped price in China as an attack on Xpeng, which is concerning, but I think it\'s a wash long term.\n\nNio has a massive government backing, but people forget or don\'t realize that Xpeng also received bailout and tax credits. Seems like the CCP likes both companies. Xpeng also has backing from Alibaba and what essentially amounts to the government of Qatar, both of which are nothing to sneeze at.\n\nTo me, while they both do EV, they\'re two completely different things. It\'s unfair to compare to older models, but if I had to, I see Nio being a Mercedes or BMW, with Xpeng being the Toyota. There\'s space for both, and I do think both succeed long term. It\'s a hard call this early in the game, but solely off the infrastructure, financial backing, and path to cash flow positive, I\'m a little higher on Xpeng. At the risk of diluting your portfolio, if Chinese EV is something you want to be in, I would personally recommend being in both.

Examples include hwawai or alibaba.

It will print. just hold.', ""I took the first 1/3 that I cut from my BABA holding and added it to my JD position, so that I had a good amount of JD. Also, I held onto the KWEB. Since the regulations that hurt BABA today came out, JD and KWEB have shot up, because I guess the other ecommerce companies benefit from BABA's new anti-competitive restrictions.\n\nJD has gained massively, about $4K, my KWEB ETF has gained about $1.5K, so that cuts my BABA losses in half. I also initiated new positions in 2 other BABA competitors, PDD (made massive gains today) and TCEHY (made decent gains). So I'm doing very well in JD, PDD and TCEHY for Chinese consumer rebound/ecommerce stocks. They're doing great at BABA's expense and will continue to have improved fundamentals with the new regulations, I think. \n\nAlso, it's possible that BABA is due for a rebound. I lost a lot of money on an American industrial stock that was due for a recovery rebound this Fall, that became a value trap that kept sinking and sinking, so that I eventually sold it off and took an $8K loss. But then when when I sold, then it began to rebound... it was like the day after I sold, and I was outraged. I immediately bought back in (missing about a 6% gain) and then have enjoyed gains ever since, which I think wiped out the loss and has been making money.\n\nSo it is possible to go in deep and lose money, but then how you get out and handle the situation can cut your losses. It's possible that BABA will have a solid built-in rebound, for example. They did have a spectacular Singles Day. \n\nThe moral to my story is that it can be important what your exit plan is when you get out of a bad stock fail, I think. When something goes very wrong with a stock you believe in, there are usually reasons why and you can use those reasons (for example, JD, PDD and TCEHY are now benefitting from the regulations that are dragging down BABA, so was a good choice for me to switch, at the time). Chinese ecommerce is going to do very well for a long time and I'm happy to be in these companies. \n\nIt still is a horrible feeling to go deep and lose money even for a while.

China wasn't on the economic stage until rather recently. Some of the businesses like BABA, are what give the rest of the globe confidence in china's economic power. If they start intervening and restricting one of the poster businesses out of china, it will not do anything good for their global image. It would drastically negatively impact them, and it didn't have to happen, so why would they do it. The only reason Ant was delayed is to make sure it doesn't get the whole system into a bind like our recent subprime mortgage debacle. The govt stepping in will end up being a win win for both. China will show they have forethought when it comes to business, and BABA and China won't put the banks in a world of hurt.

Dont worry about an exit strategy, or selling anything. just buy solid companies then forget about them. Early on, i spent far too much energy worrying about my exact entry point into a stock, or when to ""lock in gains"". I spent days watching NFLX for ""the right entry point"" as it bounced a couple of bucks between $80-$85.  When doubled from $80 to $160, then freaked out when it would correct 5% or so.  dont be me.\n\n2) at 23 years old, dont worry about bond funds.  I personally carry about 20% in broad market ETF and I consider that my ""safer stuff"".\n\n3) as for specific stocks, i think you have a nice lineup. You do have a few companies that play similarly (NIO/TSLA), (BABA/ AMZN), but that\'s ok.  all of these companies are riding trends that are highly likely to hit in the mid-term future. I\'d recommend as you build onto your positions in the future you dont go too heavy in one place is all.\n\n4) One trend that I\'m personally bullish on is our shifting workforce toward the gig economy.  More people are trading work flexibility (contract type work) for stable employment.  Maybe consider something in that space? FVRR, UBER, PINS?  It\'s something I\'m keeping my eye on.\n\nOnce again, feel good about the choices you\'re making.

Put 50% of my investing money into a broad market etf right away, every week, no matter what\n\nThat’s boring so here’s what I do for individual stocks\n\n1. Pay no mind to price action. Who cares if a company’s at all time highs, 52 week lows, “still hasn’t recovered from covid”, “has tripled this year already”. It doesn’t matter. Look at the price it’s trading at *right now* and decide if that’s a fair price for the company. \n\n2. Don’t sell unless something fundamentally changed about the company or I simply no longer want to own it. This ties in above. Never sell based on price action. Dips, pumps, gap up/down, doesn’t matter. A good reason for me to not want to own it anymore is if the company pumped to levels ridiculously above anything resembling a fair value. \n\n3. I personally believe in dip buying on some occasions. Some will call this market timing but I disagree. If you already own a stock, I think the best strategy is averaging up on red weeks/months. Emphasis on averaging up. I’m not gonna sit there and average down for years. When it comes to initially opening a position, I set price targets (based on fundamentals, not arbitrary stock price numbers). If it’s below the price target, I open the position. If it’s not, I will patiently wait for it to hit that target, and in the meantime I will pursue other opportunities. \n\n4. This is where I disagree with a lot of Reddit. “Time in the market beats timing” is true but I don’t think a lot of people truly understand what that means. My point 3, imo, is not market timing. Market timing is, again imo, selling shit with the intent to “buy back cheaper” or any variant of that. I also believe grossly overpaying for an asset and saying “oh well it’s for the long term” is stupid. If it’s for the long term (i also hate when people say that, all investing is “long term”), why would you buy it thinking it’s expensive and with the expectation that it’s going to drop significantly in the near future? \n\n5. In the end I’m and always have been a net buyer. I roll my eyes when I see the daily posts on Reddit and social media about “market crash incoming! Sell!” or whatever variant of FUD is going around that day. Wealthy people, the majority at least, get rich by buying quality assets that will either appreciate in value over time or produce an income stream. Stocks do both if you’re buying the good ones. A lifetime of accumulating assets is how you generate wealth. The way I look at it, you wouldn’t sell any other asset you own just because you thought a crash was coming. Stocks should be no different. \n\n6. Least important but I do like dividends. It won’t break my decision if the company doesn’t pay a dividend (I own BRKB, BABA and VRTX) but I will take a preference to one that will pay me to own them, especially if they’re increasing that payment every year.', 'I sold all my BABA position to get on the EV hype lol', 'Please sell your BABA I beg you', 'Buy more.

So basically, you are not speculating but rather selling rights on your shares to people who are speculating that it will go up.\n\nSay for example you would sell your BABA shares if they recover to 300 anyways. Well, instead of waiting for them to reach 300 and then selling them, you can sell a call at that strike price. Right now, a 300 strike call ending on 18 December (one month from now) is trading at around $150. If the price doesn't reach 300 by that date, you get to keep the 150 dollars. If it does reach 300 or go above it, you get to keep the 150 dollars anyways and get obliged to sell your shares at the price you would have sold them at anyways. So either way you win (if your intention is truly to sell them at 300).\n\nThis is just an example. You can choose whichever strike price and date you like. The lower the strike price, obviously the higher you can sell the call for. A 280 strike call for the same date is trading at 360 dollars for example. \n\nEssentially, you're sort of artificially creating a dividend/interest out of your position instead of them just sitting there and you waiting for them to recover \n\nBut each contract is for 100 shares.

The gray area comes specifically from leverage requirements. The major micro loan players were Haier and Alipay. Previously leveraged was capped at 250% for these companies. But if you offed some of the loans into ABS products it allows you push leverage considerably beyond that. but the Chinese onshore ABS ""market"" is a shit show. if you want to borrow for less than a 50% haircut you need the parent company to guarnetee payments. Zhou Schmoe small lending company doesnt have a large enough portfolio or a good parent organization to sell or guanrtee these ABS products as such they are capped by the 250%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; What Ant\'s doing is that they are setting up this regulatory action to kill off other current and future competitors - now you basically a banking license to do this business, and only Ant will have in the foreseeable future. \n\nThis is not true. While Alipay is the largest provider of micro loans, they are the most expensive and their customers defintiley are the riskiest. Haier has a similar risk profile and that singaporean company (i wanna say fullerton, but not 100% sure on that) provides significantly cheaper loans.  This does not include traditional banking which haven\'t really made a dent in the space due to internal compliance issues with the big 4 in china. \n\nThe new regulations (draft of which was realeased early this month in a joint statement from CBRC, PBOC, etc.) require a few new things that hurt their business. Note these are a draft and not final laws. The draft resolutions are numbered and my comments are included\n\n1. Loan comapnies should reasonably determine loan amount based on ability to repay, not in excess of 300k\n   1. This is a big one. The adds for these loansharking activites have all said 500k now, no collateral. and most people borrowed on that assumption. How enforcible it is is questionable \n2. Must apply in each province for a license and no cross ""border"" lending\n   1. advantage to singaporean company and traditional banks. \n3.  Money cannot be invested in any securities, money cannot be used to purchase house or repay morgatge\n   1. This isnt clear if its the lender or lendee. Doesn\'t affect much. Prolly unenforceable. \n4. Min registred capital of 1B RMB\n   1. Definitley a plus for alibaba and Haier. maybe finally the 20 calls i get a day for people trying to loan me money will stop\n5. Leverage reforms and reserve requirements\n   1. defintiley helps the smaller guys and traditional banks\n6. Strong suggestion not to do loansharking\n   1. Again, if enforcable a big deal. Likley not. \n\n&gt;Sure they now have to do things like holding more reserves etc, but they will actually have an effective monopoly in the now legitimized private online lending business with a huge regulatory barrier of entry. \n\nThis is not guarenteed, or even likley. So i dont see BOC, ICBC, ABC or CCB just sitting their with their thumbs up their ass while Alibaby goes to corner the market. Now that these licences are required, this new business line will pass their compliance and they will begin to set up shop. \n\n&gt;In addition, they aren\'t like the central chinese banks, which frequently are required to lend to certain projects (for example infrastructure projects) which are not profitable. \n\nThis is an excellent point, but the amounts of these loans are small compared to their overall portfolio (I\'d conservativley estimate it at 2% of their loans, and by me i mean our banking analyst who i asked). But don\'t be so sure that ali wont have these requirements going forward, getting these licences isnt as straight forward as it seems. Helping Tianjin fund their stupid port will help allot with the stupid local CBRC. \n\nAll this said Ali/ANT and Haier still have a good chance of cornering this market, as they operate and adapt significalty better than the SOE\'s.

Otherwise, you should be thinking in terms of *years*.\n\nWhen thinking long-term, even a single year is too short — try more like *5*. I know it’s challenging, but remember that patience is the name of the game.\n\nAgain, if you want to think in shorter terms, that’s fine, but there are likely better securities for that approach.\n\nLet\'s look at some of the picks you mentioned.\n\n&gt;BABA\n\nLet me guess: You probably consider them to be the Amazon of China?\n\nWell, so do I -- and you\'re going to miss out if you think that\'s going to happen overnight, or even next week. You\'ve decided to keep a hold of them, and I think that\'s a wise decision.\n\n&gt;nio\n\nProbably because you see them as potentially being the Tesla of China?\n\nI agree on this as well. The same advice as above applies.\n\n&gt;ETF\n\nI\'d say a good rule of thumb for most any ETF is to hold for the long term. ETFs are a bet on an industry or a segment, not a single security.\n\n&gt;barrick gold corp  \n&gt;  \n&gt;stick with it now that more and more lock downs are initiated.\n\nYou decided to go with Barrick because you feel that lockdowns will increase, and this will increase its value.\n\nYou have one question to ask yourself: Do you think that\'s a sound strategy?\n\nIf the answer is ""yes,"" then *stick with it*.\n\nIt\'s normal and to be expected that you will not be 100% certain. If we could predict the future and the results of our decisions, we would all be Warren Buffet. But you are either making a decision based on your best guess of what will happen and the results of these events, or you are gambling. Which is it?\n\nIf it\'s the former, then stick with it. If the securities dip, buy it -- responsibly. If you\'re treating the markets like Vegas, then you need to seriously consider the risk at play.\n\nRemember the following rules of thumb:\n\n* You only realize a loss if you sell in the red.\n* No one ever went broke taking profits.\n\nIf you are making a good faith guess in your strategy, there is no reason to sell in the red. Doing so means that you are not willing to see it pan out.\n\nIf your strategy pays off, it\'s okay to take profits. If you feel that staying invested in a security runs the risk of losing what you\'ve gained, then pull out.\n\nAnd don\'t forget that you don\'t have to sell out of your entire position. If you have a good day and want to capitalize on it but feel there is more to be had, then sell a portion of your holdings.\n\nI\'d highly recommend approaching the markets with a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. Put a consistent amount of money over time into securities you have faith in, and when taking profits, do so in limited amounts.\n\nI\'d also recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xexqXNxQ5fU). Jeremy definitely has some click-baity video titles, but this is excellent advice for a young investor.\n\nFinally, spend all this energy you have around the price of your securities on researching new opportunities. Close the app. Don\'t look at the charts. Spend your time and attention on learning more about the companies you are invested in and their future, and on finding new opportunities that excite you.\n\nHopefully this helps!', 'That’s the consensus, that and possibly the ant ipo was priced in already.

There are certainly risks to owning chinese companies that do not exist here in the US, but I happen to think those risks are present in BABA's valuation - look at its valuation compared to Amazon or US tech companies. And the Jack MA speech I still don't quite understand - he is involved in Ant but stepped down from the BABA board over a year ago and is not really involved in BABA operations. So there may be backlash against Ant, but BABA can continue growing just fine without Ant going public. \n\nSo I think the risk-reward skew on BABA's valuation seems like a good buy right now - but definitely don't YOLO everything on it."", 'My portfolio of MA, MSFT, AAPL, ARKK, SQ, WMT, XLY, and BABA has been so boring and flat for the most part since I put it together in September.', 'nio &amp; palantir approaching their all time high while baba is still on the dip.

It’s a great way to value a business.\n\nMy only criticism is in the way some people develop a DCF (and I don’t get to criticize DCF because someone doesn’t do a good job at it). The DCF does require you to input an annual growth rate (along with many other coefficients). You can even do multi-stage DCF models that accounts for different growth rates over time.\n\nBut how do you calculate the growth rate? That is where the real analysis lies, in my opinion. Anyone can plug numbers into a DCF and get an answer. But accurate growth projections are both an art and a science, and I will never claim to be an expert.\n\nWith a simple earnings projection (as opposed to DCF), the workload is reduced somewhat. I analyze how much revenue/earnings a business will be able to achieve by a certain time, and then assign a PE multiple. Way simpler than determining the many variables of a DCF. This means I get to spend more time analyzing the business instead of analyzing my DCF model, which will probably yield better results in the long run (at least for me, I hope).\n\nFor example, one of my largest positions is a REIT called Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). I could spend a lot of time perfecting a DCF model for the business, but I prefer to read their earnings calls, study what their partners and customers say about their business, and examine the economic environment surrounding them.\n\nIIPR has a large net-cash position, and has 61 properties in 16 states. Based on their strategy (which you can glean from the earnings calls), growing to 150 properties, in 25 states, in three years time, is well within their capability. Their earnings at that point would be triple what they are now. If the stock price in three years was valued at a PE of 30 (acceptable for a fast-grower with a strong balance sheet), this implies a 75% increase in share price from today. That’s a great return over three years (and this doesn’t even account for a forward dividend yield of 3.1%).\n\nSorry to ramble on. Just want to emphasize that you can make great returns sticking to the fundamentals, and that their is more than one way to analyze the fundamentals. DCF is the “business school” method of valuation.

Publicly listed companies in the United States are required to submit many types of reports to the SEC according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), even Nikola.  According to Nikola\'s reports, they are losing money per share!  So yes they are most likely a bogus company because they have no revenue, and potentially fraudulent information with regard to how they are pitching their company to investors and their road to commercializing a real product, but that does not mean they are committing fraud based on GAAP- so far its pretty clear they have no product, no revenues, and are losing money.  \n\nWhen any investor evaluates a company and does their due diligence, they should be checking the fundamentals of the company they are looking at.  This includes balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements. This will give them a reasonable idea about how the company is operating, whether or not that company is generating cash, whether or not they have significant amounts of debt, how their business operates on a monthly/quarterly basis, etc.  \n\nThe issue right now, is that based on current regulation in the United States, companies in China listed on the New York Stock Exchange are not required to report any of the above information according to any accounting rules set (GAAP or otherwise).  Without any rules in place and a company being able to report whatever they want, the investor must have upmost confidence with regard to the accuracy and the sincerity of the information being presented by the company.  \n\nGiven the activity we have seen from Chinese companies being exposed as fraudulent in this year alone, coffee and EV companies alike, to me as an investor, I am not willing to make any bets on any companies that do not comply with SEC peekaboo audits by GAAP principles.

I bought back Into NIO bc it\'s starting to dip and I wanna atleast have a toe dipped in the meme stocks.\n\n\nFor the most part, all the rest are long term holds. I had 14 tesla shares at one point all for the same avg but I sold like 8 @420ish and then another 5 @418ish. I used those tiny gains to diversify into what you see today basically. I did the math and I\'d be about the same if I had held onto tesla and sold at 580 let\'s say, but I didn\'t like having 40% in one stock; even if I believe the fuk outta Tesla.

Also to get into some more hospitality for the inevitable reopening. I was thinking cruise lines maybe, among others, but I\'m afraid of going for the lower ones and them filing for bankruptcy. I know royal caribbean has enough cash to stay afloat for years tho, so have been thinking of jumping into them and watch them rise from the ashes (hopefully).\n\n\n\nMy short term goals are to invest more and more Into ETFS every month with a bit of stocks depending on price movements/any big dips/corrections. I\'m thinking maybe 85% ETFS and 15% stocks moving forward. And maybe doing up to 50-50 splits on ETFS and Stocks depending on how big a future corrections/drop is.\n\nLong term goals are to get more and more into clean/green energy. Everything related to EV/EV infrastructure/manufacturing.Something genetics like BEAM (still looking into others). Space related things. AI robotic type companies. And cloud/software in general.\n\nAll these would be budgeted and invested appropriately. For example, I\'d prob invest 1000 every month and split it up from there. Maybe do 80% goes to immediate/short term goals (with the appropriate splits again) and then the remaining 20% goes into long term goals.\n\n\nI\'m not really interested in big oil or any of the major car companies tbh. I\'ve looked at GM a bit but that\'s about as much I\'d be willing to dip my toes into those (as of rn atleast).\n\n\nI guess do you guys got any thoughts? Comments? What do you think I should break into next considering my goals listed above? Suggestions for stocks I should look into? \n\nIf you wanna talk more feel free to DM me!

Because they are the absolute leaders when it comes to quantum computation, and they enjoy a gigantic moat over everybody except IBM. Many other startups don’t have the scale, the promising ones like Rigetti or Xanadu will probably be bought over by big companies in the near future. It’s not priced in yet, the long term horizon is about 10-15 yrs before they take over the profit calculations. Microsoft is going the better route imho, topological fault tolerance is gonna be the way long term. But google is more aggressive over the intermediate term, so if your investment horizon is &lt;25 yrs, probably alphabet is a better investment. Then again, any first gen quantum computer would likely be cloud based, and azure &gt;&gt; google cloud.

The 800b market cap of BABA is the total market value of the company.\n\nSo on question 3, options (including LEAPs) are private contracts to buy a stock at a certain price. After delisting options will no longer be available on the exchange, but the options themselves will continue to be valid until their expiry. However, the price of these options may well change. Which brings me on to question 1:\n\nThe market value of a company corresponds to the expected discounted future returns of that company. Supply and demand of ADRs (or stocks generally for that matter) does not directly affect the 'true' value of the company per se. Theoretically it can make as much money as it was always going to, and deliver those returns to a more limited set of stockholders. HOWEVER, in practice delisting will affect the company in a number of ways: first, it's ability to raise further capital from US markets through stock dillution will obviously be more limited. Second, the company will undoubtably suffer a reputational hit which may affect the price of its bonds or even international sales. So the 'true' value of the company may fall. \n\nWhile stock holders will continue to hold that stock following delisting, the liquidity of that stock will obviously take a massive hit, and even a relisting in London may be seen as at risk of a similar law coming into effect there. This lack of liquidity will almost certainly result in a significant drop in the price of the stock, as even if that stock could reasonably be held to have the same returns as previously expected, investors will see the stock as being riskier due to the difficulty of disposing of the stock quickly should they become aware of some bad news for example.\n\nLastly, should delisting occur, independently of the factors I've discussed above, we should consider what this signifies in the broader context: that the relationship between the CCP and the US has deteriorated - and thus we can expect that Chinese companies in general (even those that aren't delisted) to probably take a hit."", ""Yes, your dad is right.\n\nNo, his stock pick are bad. \n\nSafer= spread = ETF (look for an ETF with a low cost if your planning to keep it really long, difference between 1,5% cost and 0.5% doesnt seem much but it will be a lot over time)\n\nAbout stocks (and this is an opinion)\n\nSince you are young, you want stocks that will last.

I do have a couple questions, though.\n\nIn regards to BP, why do you think BP will invest too much in wind energy? In general, renewable energy is an extremely speculative area with a lot of unknowns, and from the admittedly little research I've done, it seems like BP is going for a more broad approach because of the unknowns. It seems to be researching a lot of different areas and making small steps in a bunch of directions. Either way, I will look into some other energy stocks because I'm interested in upping my exposure there and I don't have a crazy amount of faith in BP. \n\nMy next question: What worries you about BABA? Is it specific to it or does it have more to do with the Chinese market in general? Chinese stocks are certainly a bit more on the risky side, but for now I feel good about BABA at least for the medium-long term. It seems like there is a lot of negative priced into the stock that isn't necessarily indicative of bad long term performance, making it seem under-valued to me. With all that said, I'm not super well informed on the intrinsics of the Chinese market or BABA, so if I'm missing something please tell me. \n\nAlso, I'm in a constant debate about whether to invest in BRK.B. I do think it is a good investment long term, but I'm weighed down by the fear of Warren Buffet dying. I actually think the company is well prepared for his eventual death, but I'm confident it will crash on the immediate when he dies.

Ultimately these macroeconomic challenges will pass, while BABA continues to grow it’s business by providing valuable (necessary) services to their market at strong &amp; expanding margins.

From him, I've learned that from WW2, the United States was the sole winning superpower.  We were largely undamaged while everyone else was destroyed.  We also owned the majority of the gold in the world  Consequently, the US got to decide the rules of the world, and we became the reserve currency of the world.  Since then, we've moved from gold backed dollar to the petro dollar.  Now, China has been making inroads on becoming the next superpower which threatens US dominance (and consequently Western dominance).  So, the US is now engaged in 4 of 5 types of wars with China.  These include trade war, geopolitical war, capital war, and technology war.  The last being a hot war, which we're not in.  Anyways, Ray Dalio believes that a Big Debt Crisis may be upon western countries including the US.  Basically there is too much debt (government, corporate, and household debt).  The US and other countries have used up their tricks (central bank levers and monetary policies) too much, and we're running out of effectiveness.  Europe has actually dropped their interest rate below 0 to negative numbers.  China on the other hand has a lot of  interest rate room left, and there in a better position macroeconomically speaking.  Ray Dalio advocates for an All Weather portfolio.  This means you diversify your investments by asset classes.  This includes domestic equities, international equities, precious metals, real estate or reits, bitcoin, commodities, treasury bonds, TIPS, cash, etc.  This will hedge against volatility.   Right now, Ray Dalio is mainly in favor of domestic equities, international equities (mainly China), and gold.  I'm personally holding BIDU, TCEHY, BABA, and considering MCHI.  This diversifies not only by geopolitical risk but also by currency risk as China is looking to expand their currency influence throughout their region.  Hope that helps.""]"

I love all the ARK ETFS (read up on Catherine Wood of ARK).  $VOO is a blue chip ETF, you can just invest and forget about it.  If you don't know what an ETF is, it's an 'exchange traded fund' created to mimic an index.  So $VOO is modeled on the S&amp;P 500's growth, which is \\~8% every year.  So with $VOO, you can expect to make about 8% gains each year.  ARK is the same, but Cathie Wood is a genius and $ARKK made over 164% gains this year.
