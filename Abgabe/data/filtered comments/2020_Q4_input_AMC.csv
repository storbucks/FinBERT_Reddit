With that said, it feels like there a lot of other stocks to play a good news turnaround bounce that have as much or better upside with less downside potential.\n\nI’m pretty open about oil and gas being my bounce back play, but even without a huge bounce back at least I’m getting a solid div rate on the hold and just about 0 chance of losing it all on a bankruptcy filing. My biggest risk on the play, PSX for full disclosure, is probably just lagging the market as I’m likely to get some appreciation from the current valuation even on a slow turnaround given the nature of their business.\n\nCruise lines would seem to also offer the same risk as AMC but a better reward opportunity.', 'There are just better options today than going to a brick and mortar movie theater. Large families it’s much to expensive and small groups make little money and ultimately can better enjoy a movie in privacy rather than going to a theater with people who may ruin the experience. \n\nThis isn’t just an AMC issue. Cinemark lost 20% net profit in 2018, and another 10% net profit in 2019. Regal had lost 33% net profit in 2017 and the outlook hasn’t been great since. The exhibition industry as a whole has dropped quickly. It was down 5% from 2018 to 2019. I certainly hope we don’t see these businesses close, but it’s just false that movie theaters have done well. Picking and choosing specific theaters that have a better formula when the industry is failing doesn’t change that. Even after theaters reopening, they still have poor attendance.\n\nJust like middlemen salesman trying to control the flow between manufacturer and consumer, theaters are losing their hold of the industry when consumer and manufacturer have found success through direct streaming. \n\nYou also need to remember that theaters don’t make their money on tickets. They need people to buy their food. The food industry is still struggling to return, even though it’s practically a necessity to most Americans. What can we expect for theater snacks when the food industry as a whole is still stunted? There is a long climb up and I don’t see many consumers rushing to support it. Cruiseliners are even doing better in the market. The average American just doesn’t care for theaters to return.', ""I think that you are focused on solely 1 type of people: people that watch movies as gatherings of 4+ and are fine with just decent quality. For those people, yeah, streaming is fine and they won't miss the theater.\n\nBut there are other types of people:\n\nWhat about the people that want the high quality cinematic experience of the theater? It would require thousands of dollars to try to match this quality at home. I know because I have spent thousands myself trying to create a high quality home theater room, but even then, it's still not quite the same. Some people value convenience more than quality, I get that, but there are definitely still many people that value the high quality cinematic experience.\n\nWhat about people that go to watch a movie alone? For them, the theater is much cheaper than the $30 cost on top of the cost for the streaming service that Disney charged for Mulan.\n\nWhat about single people going on dates with their new romantic interest? Dinner and a movie is a timeless classic date that I just can't see going away. And most people aren't going to be having a Netflix and Chill night for a first or second date, so they need a place to go.\n\nWhat about parents that want a night out away from the kids? There are some movies that parents will want to watch that the kids are not old enough for. Plus, sometimes they just want to get away and watch a movie without the kids distracting them.\n\nAlso, not all theaters were struggling financially prior to Covid. AMC was struggling and on a downhill spiral because they have terrible management. I would not recommend an investment in AMC. AMC is the biggest chain so they get all of the attention but it is a mistake to think that this poorly run company represents the entire industry. Other theaters such as Cinemark were doing fine and have good enough financials to survive Covid and at least get back close to where they were prior to the pandemic."", 'One of the poster’s arguments is whether streaming will directly impact AMC...', ""Here's my thoughts on this, regal (Cinemark, I think) just closed all theaters, AMC is probably gonna have a really had time until 2021/2022 when it will be able to reopen. If they can make it.\n\nThis is how I would play it though, if you feel strongly about them purchase the $5 call for 1/21/2022 or 1/20/2023 max expense here is then the contact + stock buy out so 139 + 500  or 180+500 while your max exposure is now 139 or 180 instead of 400.\n\nHonestly thought that $30 mark from 2016 is dreaming and I would look more at the price right before the crash in 2/2020 for it since it's been steadily falling since 2016."", ""I think that theaters will eventually make a comeback. People are sick and tired of being locked up in their house all the time and are anxious to return to normalcy and be able to go out and have fun again.\n\nThe problem with theaters thus far is that the studios have been too scared to just release the big new movies that could get people to return to the theaters. With all due respect to Christopher Nolan, I don't think that Tenet was the right movie to get people back into the theaters with. The right movie to get people back into the theaters, in my opinion, is Wonder Woman 1984. A fun superhero movie is just what the world needs right now to help people escape from the crap happening in the real world. If Warner Bros. could work up the courage to stop pushing its release date back further over and over again, and just finally release it, I think that would mark the turnaround point for many people returning to the theaters and then there are many big blockbusters for 2021 that would have people excited to go back to the theaters.\n\nThat said, I don't think that AMC is the right theater stock to invest in. Cinemark is a much better run theater company with far better financials than AMC. With AMC, I think that there is some risk of potential bankruptcy. Plus, AMC's stock had been going downhill for years even before Covid. Whereas with Cinemark, I think that there financials are good enough that they are not at risk of bankruptcy and I expect them to get back close to their pre-Covid level stock price range next year when all of the big new blockbusters release which would be a huge return given that they are currently trading at just around $8 and before Covid, they were consistently in the $30 to $40 range and had been maintaining that range for many years prior to Covid."", 'As others have said, this is a sink or swim gamble. Can they hold out long enough without going bankrupt for us to get a vaccine and return to normal life?\n\nUse the expected value formula. Lets say scenario A is that they return to normal, so $30/share. Scenario B is that they go bankrupt, and the stock is worth zero. The EV formula will give you a fair price, depending on the probability of each scenario (commonly stated as P(A) and P(B)).\n\nEV = A \\* P(A) + B \\* P(B). \n\nEV for AMC = $30 \\* P(survival) + 0 \\* P(bankruptcy). Because of the zero scenario, this simplifies to EV = $30 \\* P(survival).\n\nWhat is your probability of survival? Well, given that the stock is currently $4, the implied P(survival) can be solved by the equation $4 = $30 \\* P(survival). That puts P(survival) = 13%.\n\nYour job is to determine whether that is accurate. If the market is pricing the implied survival probability too low, you can buy and take the other side. This is where fundamental analysis and market knowledge is incredibly useful.\n\nOne good place to check is the AMC bond yields. During bankruptcy, yields should spike depending on the risk. Google says the yield is now 7.8%. Companies like CCL were priced closer to 11% during impending bankruptcy scenarios, indicating the bond market at least thinks AMC has a decent chance to survive this.\n\nThat said, looking at the chart for AMC it is back in 2016 that it was at $30, so I don\'t really see ""post-covid-recovery"" Scenario A being back at $30.... it was having problems way before covid. Scenario A is probably closer to $10.', ""AMC is chinese backed, so I don't see them going bankrupt any time soon"", 'Effectively this happens.\n\nThe go bankrupt.  Company stock at zero.\n\nThey liquidate all assets to pay some debts, this is why bond holders get partial payouts.\n\nIn liquidation they sell their theatres, contracts, and IP including the AMC name to a new company that then issues stock.', '$30 in 2016 and $14 in 2017. Down to $7 before the pandemic rocked the market.  \n\nAMC has a long way to go to recover in an industry that is going to see fundamental changes as the pandemic eases and people resume their normal lives. \n\nIF they can get to their prepandemic levels within a year of a vaccine release you’re looking at less than 100% return on your investment if you buy today. \n\nThere are a lot of companies that have been hit hard by the pandemic that were in much better shape prepandemic, have a high likelihood of recovery, and are still trading low.\n\nI’d consider airlines and industrial aviation. No matter how bad off they are and how much public opinion is against bailouts Washington isn’t going to let China dominate American air travel and they sure as hell won’t let Boeing go under. \n\nIMO AMC is high risk mediocre reward. If you do want to play AMC I’d consider Jan 2023 $5 calls. If you can get contracts at $1.5 you limit your risk to $1.5 per share as opposed to $4 a share and if they manage to turn it around before bankruptcy you should be able to profit.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Earnings on 11/4 will probably see shares slump again. If you’re going to roll the dice with AMC at least wait for earnings.   \n\nAlso, for anyone really considering AMC you should recognize it’s a legit gamble with a very real chance of walking away with nothing. Only spend what you’re okay with losing and limit your losses with options instead of shares.

There\'s a lot of zealous market optimism about ""getting back to normal"" that won\'t happen for a long time (and not the day after the vaccine comes out either). The 6ft thing doesn\'t keep people from getting infected, the virus can travel a long distance if in a closed-air environment. The bottom line is theatres need a strategy for minimizing transmissions before they can genuinely re-open. The expectation that their market will be largely immune people anytime in the next year isn\'t grounded in reality, imho. If they create a strategy to bring-back the drive-in movie or a technically unique and effective way of sterilizing theatres, have a strategy to compete in streaming, then might be the time to buy-in.\n\nidk a lot about the stock but if its fate is tied to perceived covid pandemic severity, winter is going to be tough on AMC.', 'They were about to declare bankruptcy and were only saved by government intervention. They may recover, but their margins were incredibly low to begin with and the cost to maintain their business is just so massive.\n\nwhen people have learned they can get a similar experience for an equal or lesser price, I’m not sure AMC will be able to keep its scale. Most movies only cost like $20-30 to buy(the price of 2 movie tickets) and most middle class families will have realized that they could afford a nicer movie setup in their living room with the money they saved. \n\nMy guess is we’ll see a rise in live theatre/outdoor productions and films and a drop in movie theatre revenue. Even if we feel safe at the movies again, I’m just not sure it’s an experience people will value now that we’ve been reminded the benefits of watching from home.', ""I think theaters will stick around but they are going to be switching over to high end experience with big recliner chairs and food service like Alamo Drafthouse.

With every passing week, something else seems to be moving to 2021 or sent direct to streaming - and I\'d really honestly be surprised if a lot of the Christmas stuff isn\'t bumped to 2021 at some point in the coming weeks. Cineworld closed because of the same issues AMC is facing - Cineworld\'s CEO said on CNBC that the company was “kind of a grocery shop that have no food to sell.” AMC has acted like it was the right decision to stay open, I don\'t agree with that at all.\n\n""Of course this could also be the tipping point where we stop going to movie theaters entirely and begin to shift new releases to at home streaming, which wouldn\'t bode too well for AMC I imagine.""\n\nIt\'s likely not one extreme or the other. IMO, moviegoing is like the mall; it isn\'t going away but will likely settle into being a smaller business going forward. Some theater operators will probably go bankrupt if this situation goes well into 2021. Theater operators that make it through will probably close a number of screens in the years ahead. I think there were a lot of things where growth was accelerated during this crisis and a number of things where a pre-existing decline was accelerated. Movie theaters are in the latter category.\n\n""In 2016, AMC stock price was hovering around $30.00, now it\'s around 4.00 last I checked.""\n\nDon\'t buy something simply because it was much higher at one point.', ""What's AMC?

The only reason I brought it up is because at this point literally any action on AMC is speculation and the options play limits your losses.\n\nAn options contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares at a set price in a given amount of time.\n\nToday AMC is $4 per share. Buying 100 shares would cost $400.\n\nI suggested that if you like AMC enough to buy stock that you should consider options instead.\n\nIf you buy a contract on AMC with a $5 strike price and a Jan 2023 expiration at $1.50 then you gain exposure to 100 shares for $150.\n\n100 shares x $1.50 = $150\n\nThat gives you 3 years for the stock to go up before you must exercise the option or lose your initial investment. \n\nBecause you paid $1.50 for the option and the strike price is $5 AMC would need to hit $6.50 a share for you to break even on the investment. \n\nYou can also sell the option at any time before the expiration. If AMC shoots to $5 a share by next Friday the value of your option will increase as people will be willing to pay more for the option than they would have today. \n\nTime also effects the value of an option. If AMC stays flat for a year at $4 then the option will be worth less than it is today because there is less time left for the stock to move making it a slightly riskier investment (I say slightly because we still have 2 years) the closer an option is to expiration the faster it will lose value on a flat stock price. \n\nSo a year from now maybe AMC is flat and you are losing faith in it going up so you sell the option for $1.25 taking a $25 loss for the contract. $0.25 x 100 = $25.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that it stays at $4 for 3 years. Either the company will overcome the pandemic or it won’t. My argument is that given the risk I think it is a safer bet to spend $150 on a long term option than to spend $400 to own 100 shares outright.\n\nDon’t play options until you understand them.

From what I\'ve seen, you can expect what you have always expected. I\'ve seen no difference in that since the reopening.\n\nYour statement about Cinemark losing 20% net profit in 2018 and 10% net profit in 2019 is true, but there are explanations for that such as the costs associated with Cinemark investing in digital marketing and launching their loyalty program. Net income for the three years prior to that since 2015 was growing and revenue has been growing every year for the past 5 years prior to the pandemic including during that time period. Also, theatrical attendance was said to be stable prior to the pandemic even in the face of all of the new streaming services launching. Obviously, this is not a high growth industry, but the reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nAnd they have had poor attendance since reopening because the big blockbuster movies that would get people back in the theaters have not come back yet. Looking at the schedule for 2021, I see a lot of big blockbusters that I\'m pretty confident will bring people back, especially if we get a vaccine.\n\nI still think that you are only focused on one type of movie-goer and ignoring the other types of movie goers like I outlined in my previous post. There is no better alternative for people that want the highest quality cinematic experience, people that like being part of the hype for a big new blockbuster, singles, parents wanting a night out away from the kids, and people going on dates with their new romantic interest. These types of people will return to the theaters in my opinion.\n\nI again disagree with you that people don\'t care to see theaters return. Some people don\'t, but I believe that many do and I have my money (literally) on that we will see that people still care next year when all of the big blockbusters finally release. Like I said previously, I would not invest in AMC since they have terrible management and financials, but I can\'t see this industry dying and there are still quality companies like Cinemark that can continue to do well enough in this industry for it to live on. I believe by this time next year, theaters will be mostly back to normal and Cinemark will be at least double and maybe even triple its current price of $8.44 which would be a pretty fantastic one year return. Hell, even a quadruple is not out of the question in my opinion.

Earnings, however, could be different for a number of reasons depending on management, accounting, philosophy, or luck.

For me, I lean into revenue, particularly with growth companies, as revenue will always inform earnings. Management, strategy, execution of strategy, follow-through, and all of the 'mojo' of a company will ultimately be the decider of whether they will be profitable... which will always be informed by revenue.\n\nSure, but none of that explains why revenue makes for a better benchmark. Luck won't explain earnings, not consistent earnings over time at least, but if the rest are explaining, then it follows it's a better, more investment worthy company we're talking about. Revenue may inform earnings, which underscores the importance of earnings. Revenue only matters in light of how much earnings it informs or will inform in the case of non-profitable companies.

Wal-Mart has by far and away the highest earnings in the world (ARAMCO notwithstanding, I don't know much about them), and they're not the highest market cap, in large part because of their razor thin margins. The fact is, if Tesla get's $1.4T in revenue like in your hypothetical, with a 1.86% net margin like they have now, vs Apple doing the same with a ~21% margin, it's not going to have the same market cap, at least, it won't be as well justified if it is."", 'I wouldn’t touch AMC, the airlines or Dave and Busters tbh', 'Seriously doubt the theater experience is going away. \n\nLion King remake = 1.7 billion theatrically \n\nMulan remake = 60 mil steaming\n\nThere just isn’t nearly the same amount of money to be made in VOD.

Theatrical releases were crushing it.  Movie after movie clearing 500 million.  Many of the bigger releases like Marvel clearing 1 billion.   So they could justify dumping 250 million into production and then another 250 mil into marketing if they were going to make 1 billion in theaters.  \n\nThis kind of system works if they can pump out a crappy Lion King remake and make 1.7 billion.  It doesn’t work if they go straight to steaming and make 60 million bucks like Mulan.  \n\nThey need theaters for this to make sense.  VOD has been a failure.   If ever it would work, it would be right now during covid but people just aren’t willing to spend money to watch at home.  No digital release has come remotely close to pulling in the type of profit they get in theaters. \n\nSo for an extremely low budget movie like Borat (10-20 million), selling to an amazon might make sense.  But for the huge summer blockbusters we are use to watching (which cost up to 500 million to make and promote), no way.  That’s why all the major movies are still delayed with hopes the theaters will return.   \n\nI actually don’t believe that theaters will die.  People need something to do outside their homes and movies are easy.  If we get past covid, people will flock to theaters again.  I think it’s possible companies like AMC might go bankrupt before we get to that point (AMC could run out of cash by the end of the year while Cinemark supposedly has a year's worth of liquidity).

2020-11-03,"[""Well, the implication is that you think I only have a spare $1000 to my name and that you're concerned I'm betting all my money on AMC. In reality, it's ~1/40th of my non-retirement funds for investing. Betting less than $1000 on a single thing is not worthwhile to me as the potential return would not be large enough to matter, especially when AMC is at absolute best a 4 or 5x return."", ""&gt; I 20x + each one and used the gains to build my business.\n\nYeah, and I think this is actually the reason i *shouldn't* buy AMC. Even best-case, there is a 0% chance of a 20x return. Absolute best case, 4x return. Better off with cruiseship stock if anything."", ""Its not bad actually. Hear me out. AMC is probably the biggest cinema presence where I am on the East coast. We have a few Regal Hadley (Cinemark) theaters here but its primarily AMC. Hollywood has been playing around with streaming major releases but there for as much as everyone moans about the price of tickets, people will still go out to the movies. Year after year, box office records smash previous ones save for this one. Its a gamble but it can pay off huge if AMC makes it to next year. If it doesn't, brick and mortar theaters still won't go anywhere so long as Hollywood keeps cranking out blockbusters.

Companies that had previously been laggards performed exceptionally well today. Look at Visa and Mastercard; prior to today, they were merely up 6% and 5% each YTD. Other companies which experienced a major pop were the airlines, though, if you look at a company like American Airlines, it\'s still down around 45% YTD and has not had a positive year since 2017. AMC was up 50%+ at it\'s peak today, which is wild, but not entirely unexpected considering that it\'s down substantially for the year (again, AMC hasn\'t had a positive return since 2016). \n\nIf you are a trader, you\'re probably loving today.

As other commenters alluded to, emergency approval has not been granted for the Pfizer vaccine, people are still getting covid (it *looks* like the cases are increasing), there is no distribution plan (yet), etc. On the flip side, we have to understand  that names like Zoom, Fastly, Teledoc, Ostk, etc. were (and still are) up triple digit percentages this year, and going for a 1,000%+ return in a year is probably not realistic (though my account wouldn\'t mind it at all). The things that gained some ground today are primarily items that are down huge for the year (e.g. Wells Fargo was down 58% for the year prior to today, Boeing was down 52%, Delta was down 45%, Royal Caribbean Cruises was down 55%.) \n\nI did not make any changes to my positions or allocations today.

AMC dropped a lot after the vaccine news though, a lot of that drop was because the spike was an overreaction, but it seems like it's kept falling because of the dilution of shares it announced as well as the number of covid cases being at all time highs. And if WW gets delayed, or the vaccine doesn't get an FDA approval, or we go into another lockdown, it'll just keep falling.

A lot of AMC debt did seem to be renovations, probably within the last 5 years at least for me, theaters went from simple seats with popcorn and soda, to recliners with a full menu and alcohol, so it's easy to see a company rack up debt like that. \n\nThey stated in their earnings call that worst case scenario they have enough cash until early next year, and with the vaccine news coming out it seems like worst case scenario isn't what's happening. I guess my thought process is, if they're able to survive this, the stock should jump quite a bit due to next year having double the amount of blockbusters coming out. \n\nI'm not looking at AMC as an investment, but it seems like at the prices it's at now, especially if it continues to drop, it might be a decent swing trade. I think $6 is a realistic target since that was the pre covid price and it touched that a couple times this year with anticipation of theaters opening and Tenet keeping its release date. Might be able to touch it again if Wonder Woman keeps its Christmas release."", ""For sure, it's extremely risky and I'm aware of the huge amount of debt AMC has, I was just thinking that the movie theater industry is unique when compared to the other recovery stocks out there in the sense that the movies that got delayed this year are now going to get released next year, so they'll have double the amount of blockbusters coming out in a single year. \n\nAnd although CNK might have better financials, AMC has been attempting a lot of ways to survive this and it seems like they've been the front runner on adapting to the times IMO within the theater industry. \n\nBut like you said, the industry as a whole is risky right now, I just don't think its the dying industry that everyone says it is."", 'At the time, I purchased 11/13/20 $2.5 AMC Put Buy option with .33 Premium.

Just because you don't think movie theaters are dead, doesn't mean AMC isn't."", ""Lolol I'd go all in on AMC but I'm blowing my wad on Betamax, AOL, and NorTel baby.\n\nJesus"", 'Please don’t be delusional.

If you want to pin yourself in a spiral of offerings and constant shareholder dilution, then please buy AMC.', ""I personally don't see the upside.  As a short-term COVID play, it's literally gambling at this point (I mean, just look how volatile other COVID-sensitive stocks, such as the travel industry, have been this year)\n\nLong-term outlook is not good either.  AMC, Cinemark, and Regal - unless they find a way to innovate, they are going to go the way of Blockbuster and Redbox.  The media consumption model in this world has been transforming long before COVID, and the movie theater industry has been complacent and has largely failed to adapt."", 'They’ve had more taken away from them from local governments, as well as their supply of movies, with a movement to simultaneous digital releases. AMC is a big gamble. So is IMAX, although I think they are better because of structure', ""I'm gonna pass on AMC. It was a dying business before and will continue to die."", ""&gt; I don't know a single person on earth who doesn't enjoy a movie in theaters.\n\nI used to love movie theaters. But most theaters today are tiny. Those little screens are barely bigger than the experience I can have at home.\n\nI still go to movies for big event stuff like Star Wars and what not. But I'm only going to the big IMAX screens. Or once in a while I might watch a movie in a nice theater with recliner and food.\n\nAMC's top days are over.

I’m overall gonna break even tomorrow if it is 2.17$. Right now it is wiggling around 2.20$. Hoping for a spike. \n\nHere’s a question: \n\nIf you have every intention of buying a stock, and you consider a limit buy... why not just buy a call that is way below the current value? \n\nFor example, AMC has 1$ calls for 1.17 per share. I bought 100 shares, and tomorrow I will have my 100 shares to hang on to, as well as a small profit if it stays above my break even of 2.17.\n\nTo me this makes sense mathematically but it does seem strange to buy calls below market value. Am I missing something?\n\nKeep in mind, I know these prices may be very irregular considering how strange and volatile AMC stock is.\n\nThe calls are insanely cheap until they’re very far down below the 52 week low.', 'I’m in to Disney.

I will sell on the spike in a week. Or I’m wrong. I will be just fine if I am wrong, but I’ll be pretty happy if I am right.', 'My long plays will not be in theaters at all. I’m mostly all in on clean energy, EV charging, and CEMEX.\n\nMay AMC play is a 1-2 week move, and I won’t have a penny if AMC shares by mid January. Buy, sell. Anticipating an upswing in the next several days. \nIf I’m wrong the loss will be totally bearable. But fun to see it play out.']"
