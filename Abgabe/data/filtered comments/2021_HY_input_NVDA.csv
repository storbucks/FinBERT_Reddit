I have absolutely no idea if they will drop in coming weeks, months, year. Everyone has their own strategy but my personal strategy is more long term focused where I just buy companies I think will be bigger in the future based mostly of my own intuition/observations but also the intuition/observations of people\'s intelligence I respect (WKHS, CRSR were recommendations from friends and I found NNDM, EVGN, AQB bottom fishing some of Cathie\'s ETF\'s ). I plan on holding the companies I buy for at least 10 years and I ride through pretty much any/all volatility even extended periods  of it, (-50% on CMG for like a year before it finally turned, down like 20/30% on TSLA for a long time also, I could go on but I think you get the point, you will eventually have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death) . \n\nPersonally I view timing the market as opening a Pandora\'s box of greed and fear that I\'d rather leave closed.\n\nIf I see a company I think is going to be big in the future I just get a piece of it and scale into the position over time as I get more cash available. I  view waiting for pullbacks / trading around my position in companies I think will be very good long term companies as nothing but straight up greed. The ""I want more of this amazing company at an even cheaper price, even-though it\'s a cool idea right now"" mentality got me burned missing out on NVDA when I was starting out, saw it at $100 thought it was super cool company doing interesting stuff but I was going to wait for a pullback since it just ripped from $25, I\'m still waiting. The opposite mentality can also burn you, I bought into HMNY hype because I liked the service and now that total investment is worth less than 5 cents lol.\n\n I know its kinda corny and probably not what you want to hear but you just have to find your own strategy that works for you in your own financial/life situation which I have absolutely zero knowledge about, you just have to make your own decisions that you are comfortable with (comfort is very important to me personally because you don\'t want to start freaking out and changing your decision making process based on emotions you get when your uncomfortable).\n\nNothing that says you can\'t buy both either, even if you\'ve only got $50 or something with fractional shares you can get a piece of both companies :) \n\nSomething I\'ve found helpful personally is just living frugally and not investing any money I would need to take out of my account for living expenses, that way if it tanks it\'s not like a fuck I can\'t pay for rent/groceries situation. I think thinking in % helps also, you\'re not up $100, you\'re up X%.   \n\n\nTLDR: I have no idea, why not both with fractional shares?', ""SQ, but I didn't have a lot of it.

I remember watching AMD's recent CPU release and the Nvidia 3000 series release and they were talking about new semiconductors coming out that in 5 nm soon, as well as coming closer to getting 3 nm. But it's a time consuming process to build these chips. It costs billions to build new facilities, and takes a few months. They are in the process of expanding current production because literally everything uses them. Car manufacturers can't make new cars because they can't get chips to put in them. GPU shortages because they can't get chips. Console shortages due to chips not available. Most semiconductor companies have production already to the max through 2022. TSM is a good company. It is the defacto #1 worldwide producer and industry leader in semiconductors. Samsung is #2. There are smaller companies I've been diving into as well. AMD Zen 4 CPUs sound amazing. But I honestly suggest getting into something that interests you naturally and do DD on them. I was doing DD by just keeping up with leaks like the one below. Should have started investing last summer instead of just getting excited about new releases lol. But I hate giving advice when I am quite literally a novice at this. You could also look at semiconductor ETFs if you don't want to just pick one. \n\nI'm currently looking at TSM, AMAT (they make semiconductor foundry parts), UMC, MU, LSCC. And I'm keeping an eye on AMD for their Zen 4 release next year. It should also support DDR5 RAM, which is twice as fast as DDR4, and PCI.e5 too. But yeah, I love keeping up with this market and I have tried to get into DD for industries I'm not so interested in and it always flopped. I did buy POWW, an ammunition manufacturer, just because my dad talks about ammo shortages all the time. It's done well the last few weeks and I anticipate it will continue that route until earnings are reported on February 16th. I do not plan on keeping it long though, as I believe having a Democrat president is contributing to the shortages. So just keep stocks in mind whenever you learn about shit and do some DD on those things. \n\nNot financial advice, blah blah blah, I'm an idiot and also lose money haha. I also am only playing around with $1.5K so I just have handfuls of each one and it's not a big deal if it's lost.\n\nHere's a leak on AMD and info on what TSMC is working on:\nhttps://wccftech.com/tsmc-5nm-products-leaked-amd-zen-4-cpus-rdna3-gpus-nvidia-hopper-and-potentially-an-intel-xe-gpu/"", 'Motorsport is usually waved off as marketing (for large manufacturers) as it is expensive and yes, there may be some money coming in but Formula E is not on a level with F1 or even WEC in terms of money of profitability.

It\'s nothing flashy consdering whats going on today but I performed better than the S&amp;P 500 and I was able to sleep well, its called risk adjusted returns, I think most of the new investors dont know what that means. I was probably lucky because I had a few years without crazy Reddit pumps which allowed me to build confidence in my strategy. \n\nJust rebuild and stop trading, you\'re so young you can still reach anything. Your initial choice of stocks sounds good to me, it was a good start. Also stop listening to Reddit when it comes to stock choices, the stock market related subs have gone to absolute shit lately, it appears to be all about pumping small caps now. You will miss a lot of good stocks because Reddit doesnt like to circlejerk around them and you will buy garbage that got pumped and will get dumped. Literally just pull up a list of the S&amp;P 500, or of global stocks and pick companies you think will have a bright future. Ignore the price.\n\nIf you invest in a company see it like marriage. Only leave them if some very very serious happens or the relationship is so bad that you just need to end it. Personally I prefer to just never ever sell, makes things simple. Maybe more boring, but simple and the average investor will perform a lot better using this strategy because most will get tempted to do the things you ended up doing. If you make the choice to never sell a stock, you will be more cautious with your choices and do more DD before you buy. If you want to have some ""fun"" then have it in a seperate account, not in your serious but successful investing account. \n\nYou will rebuild and there are strategies out there that can work for retail investors, but you need a strategy and stick to it religiously. Take some time to think of a strategy, maybe even write it down and that then is your bible. If you want to have success in the long run then trading doesn\'t work for 99% of people. Being 20 and already having made that experience in the stock market is very valuable. \n\nMy largest position is NVDA which I bought in 2016 at $60. Even if the long term chart looks flashy, there were some rough times me and NVDA went through. You\'ve also experienced NVDA trading sideways for half a year. When see your NVDA position doing that and you\'re actually investing then you don\'t really care. You know that right now they are printing as much money as they possibly could and are doing many various great things. You probably sold NVDA because you got bored of it and saw people tripling their money within a week in GME. Don\'t do that, in the long run pigs always get slaughtered. Ironically NVDA has broken out and is now above $600. \n\nThe fact that you\'ve written this thread shows that you can absolutely do it. Get yourself a strategy and stick to it. Realize that it takes a fuckload of humility to survive on the stock market. Everyone on Reddit is acting like they know it all when in fact noone knows anything, not even the big guys on wallstreet. Admit that you actually don\'t know a lot and you\'ll do a lot better. Marry great companies and they\'ll give you back way more than you ever gave them.']"

Now they have a shortage, meaning less supply than before, causing them to actually slow or stop manufacturing at certain plants.\n\nA high demand to supply ratio would have meant they can't produce more cars than before.

Nothing wrong with either of those stocks, I really like both with Apple advancing into their own computer processors and cars and Microsoft just dominating my office job (Outlook, Word, Teams, etc) and just killing it in the pandemic. Just make sure you check out ETF holdings so you know your potential overlap. If you want a portfolio that is 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that (invest in what you know) but just know that carries more risk than VTI where the top holdings are Apple (5.3%) and Microsoft (4.6%), but you also own hundreds of other stocks at 1% and below, so this one ETF is basically a massively diversify your portfolio. \n\nIf you want to ‚Äúprove him wrong‚Äù and beat out his 0.5% high yield savings, just dumping it all in VTI will pretty much do this. You want to be more risky, throw some QQQM or QQQJ in there. You want to be even more risky, ARKF (fintech) is really good in that time frame and possibly weed stocks. For you, ARKG is the genomics ARK ETF and could be life/world changing in 10-20 years.

The only risk here is a market turn, but people who have spent the last 10 years predicting a crash have missed out thousands in gains. There was a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù in 2018 and another with the covid 19 pandemic. Even putting in at the peak right before both of those, you‚Äôd be back on top already. 2008s crash (~50% drop) took 5 years to recover just to add. However, it took 5 years for people who didn‚Äôt touch their money and didn‚Äôt invest more.

I think they\'re at a good value now but definitely am not planning on having them make up as large of a percent of my portfolio until its profitable again. Would have loved to have this discussion without the assumptions and condescension :(', '&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yes but this is easier said than done. You\'re basically saying to not time the market wrong right? And tbh I don\'t have the market literacy to have confidence in recognizing signs of reversal. I mean part of the trigger that makes me average down is that I personally see signs of reversal but am wrong.\n\nSo there\'s not 100% plan for perfect timing of the market, but there are different catalysts that should drive your approach to a dip/correction/downturn/whatever you want to call it. Boeing crashes a plane, go all in and buy the dip, they\'re too big and too important to the govt to fail. Something like what\'s happening now, at a macro level - rising bond yields and a sector rotation, you know it will be choppy for a while, and with more attractive investment options than expensive, overvalued tech you know the ride back up is likely to be slower than the rapid appreciation run we were just in. Those are the types of things that help you identify that you need to go slow in buying the dip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Idk it seems like if somebody is actively trying to average down, they\'re expecting a temporary downtrend before the reversal. Idk isn\'t the purpose to catch falling knives? It\'s basically DCAing right? I don\'t think it\'s a terrible strategy to say ""I want to increase my position in AAPL daily because I think the market is going down but will rebound within the month"". But if it takes longer than you expect you will end up overleveraged regardless, you just can\'t guess this accurately. **What you can do is decrease the % you average per day, capping your gains but decreasing your risk**\n\nCatching falling knives isn\'t a good thing, you\'re basically chasing something that could kill you each time it falls so that you won\'t get killed. This is yet another place where your approach should differ depending on if you\'re dealing with a small cap or large/mega cap. Yes, you might be more aggressive buying the dip on a small cap because large swings are possible in such a short time, of course that also means is subject to fall harder. Something like AAPL doesn\'t move much in a day due to mkt cap and float, so when a dip happens, you may say - I want 200 more shares of AAPL, i\'m going to buy 150 over the next days if priace is x-or less, you get to that 150 and we\'re not on a upward trend - that means VIX has settled down, you look at futures and they\'re up over 1.5%, multiple days of gains/overall green weeks and no signs of the market moving on from the macro disrupters, then sit on that money for the last 50 shares, sure, if it bottoms out at 100 you may miss that price but get 50 at 110 on the way up, that\'s better than blowing all your cash on the fall from 140-120 on the way down, given we should look at things like AAPL as years long investments, be patient, missing $10 here on there on falling prices won\'t hurt you in the long run.\n\nI\'m not sure what you mean by the bold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;IDK, I don\'t really understand this TBH. I bought some (\\~5 shares) APPL at \\~136 too as a weekly averaging, I think I\'ve already sold it for a loss at like 125 for a total loss of $55? I had 30 shares at some point but I have 15 shares left, $55 is a drop in the bucket and I\'m honestly glad I don\'t have 20 shares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... **yes?? are you not??** and dude wtf why are you telling me how to think of my portfolio?? **I\'m heavily long term,** have held NVDA since $40, TSLA since $200 pre-split, etc. Most of my investments are for the long term. I ALSO make short term moves. I ALSO sell covered calls. I actually agree with you!!! I am LONG APPL especially over a period of years, so why do you care if I temporarily sell 20 shares @$120 and buy back 20 more @$140 2 weeks later at a loss of $400? Long term $400 is literally nothing if I\'m keeping 20 shares.\n\nI mean, do you, but I\'m really not seeing the point of selling for a loss on something like AAPL. If this were a penny play, sure, there are times when selling at a loss prevents a bigger loss. No, the $55 you loss isn\'t earth shattering, but I don\'t get the point of buying at 136 to sell at 125 then rebuy at 140. If you\'re long on AAPL, would you not simply hold each lot of shares you buy?\n\n&gt;EDIT: oops missed a point, yes being overweight in a single position absolutely poses a risk!! Please tell me if I\'m wrong but this seems like 100% fact to me\n\nWhat risk does it pose? Again, you\'re not explaining this to me. If you need your portfolio to be perfectly weighted at all times, do you, seems like a lot of unnecessary selling and possible tax events. \n\nIf I invest 10k in each of AAPL, TAN, DIS, and KO - everything is at 25%. If AAPL grows to 13k (22%), TAN to 18k (31.5%), DIS to 15k (26%), and KO 11k (19%)  - how does this make your portfolio more risky? \n\nOr are you looking at it as by buying the dip on AAPL I\'m now investing more than the 10k I invested in everything else so more of my money is at risk with that company?', 'I‚Äôd just recommend buying more stock in the companies you believe in or that have performed well to average down and then maximize your return on the next upward swing. \n\nOne of my fave stocks, GRWG, has been getting hammered, must have lost 20% of its value in a couple weeks, but I believe strongly in them and so have been increasing my position. Did that with FVRR, NVDA, other stocks as well. \n\nProblem is the damn selling continues. But it all will come back and then some. \n\nAnother way I see it, almost everything I‚Äôm losing right now are gains. House money. Eases the pain.', 'NVDA for me as well.

2021-03-16,"['It\'s my biggest position, and a good performer for the last year. A year ago, and even 6 months ago, a big part of my justification for buying Softbank was the gap in the market cap and the value of the underlying assets. But today with billions in share buybacks (originally scheduled to end this month) and Alibaba declining they\'re probably approaching a fair price for the assets, keep in mind they didn\'t dip nearly as much as the rest of tech stocks the last month or so. \n\nI think to buy at these prices you have to feel positively about a number of different assets. The first and biggest is Alibaba. The second is ARM which is part of a pending deal with Nvidia which would see Softbank get an 8% or so stake in Nvidia if it goes through, there\'s a reasonable chance it falls through and personally I think it\'s fine either way. The third is the Vision Fund projects as a whole. The original Vision Fund is 30% stockholder money with somewhat mixed results, the 2nd is entirely stockholder money that\'s done well, between the 2 there are about 140 investments with the recent success stories being Doordash and Coupang. IMO those are the 3 big ones that have more upside/downside. \n\nThen you\'ve got the ""strategic holdings"" of Softbank Corps (telecom in Japan) which I think they mostly hold onto for the dividends, though they sold a chunk of it the last year.

Yahoo Japan, which is the preferred search engine and email service for the Japanese language (powered by Google ironically). Northstar which is part of a ""liquidity management strategy"", a subsidiary in the Caymans where they park excess cash after selling assets in publicly traded tech stocks (and options). And the Latin America Fund which is smaller scale investment than the vision fund (managed by a different guy as well) with about 130 last I knew investments in tech companies through the region. \n\nGoing forward I think we\'ll continue to see the trend of the last year or so, which is whittling down more of the bigger assets to cycle into more venture fund money, and I think that\'s really where the upside of the stock is. They make a lot of bets but many of them have big enough upside to actually matter for investors. Softbank just gives you substantial exposure to the venture capital market that you can\'t get exposure to through any other stock.

2021-03-29,"['Your goal is to understand the company at present, evaluate the prospects for growth, and determine how likely you see those opportunities panning out. Have you watched shark tank? That‚Äôs basically the concept. Take the materials the company puts forward, decide if they sound compelling, poke holes in their bullshit, and then negotiate a price. Remember that it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs job to convince you. Don‚Äôt treat it like you have decided to invest and want to back into enough sound bites that back you up.\n\nStep 1: Go to their investor relations page and find their most recent 10-k. If the company is affected by covid you might also want to get last years 10-k and read them front to back (if they are several quarters old look at recent 10q as well). Read the business or overview section to learn about their total operations. Read their balance sheet to screen for high/low levels of cash and debt that concern you. The income statement is really important for understanding how much they make, how fast that has been increasing, and try to understand how those values compare to the discussion. It‚Äôs very important to look at their gross margins as well as their net margins after expenses. This is a measure of how hard it is to earn a dollar of profit.\n\nStep 2: Look at their investor presentations and their conference calls. The 10ks are regulated and companies can‚Äôt be too loose in what they say. But in presentations they can be more optimistic. You need to marry what the company says they hope to achieve vs what they can concretely report. If there‚Äôs a big gap, you need to determine the discount you will apply for the probability of failure.\n\nStep 3: Read the discussion and try to find the bear case. Find the Kevin in the shark tank. Maybe the company is doing everything right but their success hinges on some external factor (like Nvidias ARM acquisition getting approved). Or maybe the business arm that is well known to consumers is only 1/3 of the revenue base. Or maybe they have stopped buybacks and started diluting. There has to be a bear case and you need to hear it to decide.\n\nStep 4: Determine your desired price entry and consider where you would sell or buy more.

I could see AMD push the boundaries versus Nvidia with server based gaming and other areas with their amazing momentum. I bought at 78 but anything below 100 is an amazing price."", ""I'm very long on AMD. I have always been an Intel guy and for a long time they were clearly the better chip, same with Nvidia on the GPU side. AMD was always kind of a step or 10 behind. Now I can confidently say that my next PC build will without a doubt have an AMD CPU and GPU. It is actually incredible what this company has been able to achieve.\n\nOn top of just being innovative in the industry and competing with the two biggest names in their industry they have some great leadership. Lisa Su is a visionary and I don't think the company would be where it's at today without her.\n\nThere are some issues in the GPU supply chain atm but the story is the same for Nvidia and not a unique issue for AMD, so although this poses some challenges in the short term I don't see it becoming a huge issue long term. Additionally, unless I've missed something, Apple still uses AMD for their graphics, but like with Intel on the CPU side, they could lose this source of revenue soon. It just depends on how successful Apple is at cutting out the 3rd party processors and replacing them.\n\nThe only issue I see as unique for AMD is that they still lag behind on some of the lower end chips. As high as the tech world is on AMDs new GPU and the higher end Ryzen CPUs, most PC builders don't have a 5-10k budget. For now, Intel still gets you better performance for your dollar on the CPU side but the margin is closing. Nvidia still also has a clear edge on the lower-mid range GPUS.\n\nAll said though, AMD is here to stay and is going to be making noise in their industry for a long time. I don't expect to ever sell my shares honestly."", ""I remember being 19 and getting into computers in 2015. Everyone was telling me AMD was going to be huge, once they released competitive CPUs and GPUs, they were just the temporary underdog. Stock back then was just $3 a share. I ended up building my first PC in 2016 with no AMD components, but when the mining gold rush of 2017 happened I built another system using the R5 1600, and by then their stock had already quadrupled. As the years went by I bought a couple more graphics cards for mining, and their stock slowly they crept up to $20, $50, then a whopping $90 this year.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I didn't have much interest in stocks until the whole GME thing happened, but once I opened my own trading account in February I bought into a bunch of different stocks, including 3 shares of AMD. Think I might have gotten it near the peak at $94, but you know what? I have trust in them. This past year must have been EXCELLENT in terms of sales, since they finally compete on both the CPU and GPU market, plus the new consoles use AMD components as well, and ALL of these products sell out in literal seconds. I expect AMD will continue to rule the desktop CPU space, but there's a ton of room to gain on the laptop and server space as well. I'm also optimistic they will continue to gain market share on the GPU side, as they now have proven able to compete with Nvidia's best, so long as ray-tracing is not enabled, but I also think this gap will lessen as they iterate on their hardware.\n\nMy only concern is that Nvidia's experience with deep learning gives them a huge edge and AMD will revert to the GPU underdog, not just in gaming but also workspace, streaming etc. In general though I expect both of these companies to be very solid investments right now."", ""As a PC gamer and custom PC builder for gamers, most of the new market gaming PC's are built on AMD processors.  The new CPU and GPU power share tech is next level and is going to make it difficult for Intel to keep up until they start to offer their own GPU, until then Nvidia will still own the GPU market. AMD is a strong CPU and GPU producer and may knock Intel off their thrown sooner rather than later.  Full disclosure I hold stakes in all 3 of these companies."", 'I disagree honestly, just as PC enthusiast. You can buy both AMD and Nvidia cards right now, and you‚Äôll have a great card either way. But Nvidia just makes better performers on the high end. There‚Äôs also different features for content producers that steer people one way or the other, so it‚Äôs not all black and white. \n\nThe only thing exclusive to anyone, at the moment, is ray tracing from Nvidia. But we can probably expect AMD to tackle this in their new cards. \n\nAnd Intel does actually have decent offerings, despite what a lot of people say about them being so far behind. We‚Äôve seen 10400s go on sale for awesome prices for the performance. In fact, I believe all the 10 series CPUs are a pretty good value right now. So they‚Äôre kind of where AMD is with GPUs, just in the CPU space. \n\nI think the current silicon industry would be amazing for consumers if not for the crazy demand and awful shortage. Competition is through the roof, thanks to AMD. But it‚Äôs stiff, nonetheless. \n\nAs it stands, Nvidia make the best GPUs, AMD make the best CPUs, and you‚Äôd be wise to not completely fall asleep on Intel. Might take a minute, but they‚Äôre not used to being second best. Who knows what will change, but history is worth looking at.', 'Buying AMD at around 80 may make be a little painful short term.

It would be like comparing TSLA to GM. If you are investing in AMD/NVDA only for semiconductor, then you could try to compare their respective businesses. AMD makes most of their income from x86 CPU processors and their GPU lines.\n\nTake a look at their 2020 annual report: https://ir.amd.com/sec-filings/filter/annual-filings/content/0001628280-21-001185/0001628280-21-001185.pdf\n\nIn section 14 under segment reporting, of the 10B net revenue they made 65% comes from computing and graphics, 33% from custom embedded. AMD doesn't break it out by segment, so its hard to tell how much is end consumer vs b2b. And how much is datacenter enterprise builds vs individual compute usage.\n\nNow look at NVIDIA's year end report under Note 17: https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/0ec16816-55e2-4812-8f77-75cab5909247.pdfhttps://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/0ec16816-55e2-4812-8f77-75cab5909247.pdf\n\nThey made 16B in net revenue with ~15B coming form three segments: Gaming, ProViz and DC. The big difference between NVDA and AMD is that NVDA is targeting enterprise data center growth. Their YoY DC space growth was 110% in 2021.\n\nIn addition, NVDA is expanding into new markets. For example, their 10K shows revenue recognition from their automotive division which includes both embedded SoC, infotainment solutions, AI driver solutions and autonomous driving solutions. AMD doesn't have an equivalent division (at least publically...) in their organization yet.\n\nThe big difference between NVDA and AMD is that NVDA has branched out into new industries and is offering software and services stacks that go on top of the hardware components they sell as their core competency. AMD seems to still be focused as a chip manufacturer while NVDA is trying to evolve into something bigger and more.\n\n\nIn my thoughts? NVDA is more of a growth company and with that comes risk. As long as NVDA can keep expanding into new markets and winning strong revenue in those markets NVDA is a better bet. AMD will keep chugging along as aggregate market demand for silicon and chips will increase. But their revenue multipliers will be relatively flat unless they can expand their business into new markets.\n\nJust my 2c from having been invested in both AMD and NVDA. Personally I'm looking to exit my AMD position and only hold NVDA as my only exposure in semiconductors. Its a riskier play, but the entire stock market is about risk and risk management.

Always read basic on stock story (merril or yahoo provides same) comparative peers what they do best (a while back eg amd made cheap processors, nvda made premium, intc marketed well and had largest client base - went with all as I thought chips would do well but 60% amd, 30%nvda 10%intl - wish it was all nvda but all performed- still see amd investing heavily in r&amp;d and thinking they may advance on nvda price as they capture more market (paying attention to crypto helped here 2012)', ""Except for the obvious candidates (TSMC, AMD, Samsung, Nvidia and Intel) I'm holding ASML, AMAT and LRCX. \n\nThere is a lot of confirmed investment in new fabs and these three are absolutely necessary for all of them."", ""&gt; If it literally happens everytime why would someone not just buy all the dips post Ex-Div. \n\n\n\nDing ding ding.

Before taxes and fees, it shouldn‚Äôt matter to you the investor. \n\n\nBy the way. Most people don‚Äôt even notice the dip because it‚Äôs sub 1%. Like with NVDA, their quarterly dividend is less than an minute long fluctuation in their share price. \n\n\nIMO this is what makes it hard for people to comprehend. They can‚Äôt see it, therefore they don‚Äôt believe it. Since they don‚Äôt believe it, therefore it can‚Äôt be true in their eyes. However Warren Buffett broke down the math in a letter to shareholders where he makes it clear mathematically....oddly enough nobody wants to refute the Buffett and his math. \n\n\n&gt; Because people do, and price often rebounds after the drop ex dividends. Many larger cap stocks don't really dip much or dip at all post Ex-Div. Anecdotally, about half of my REITs don't really dip at all. The other half perform as expected\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs because usually it‚Äôs so small market forces often can hide it, not to mention it opens at the adjusted price, so people won‚Äôt see it unless they compare close and open prices. \n\n\nAnd also. The price doesn‚Äôt have to recover immediately or at all. A stock can have red days on the ex date. Such as COST.

I know for a fact the majority won‚Äôt even touch academic research papers on investing and another majority won‚Äôt even look at a company‚Äôs financials. Even Peter Lynch says most investors hear a tip on the bus and by the time they get home half their life savings is in that random stock. \n\n\n&gt; and find out about dividend irrelevancy and they will make their own decision. If they do not research more, then they kinda deserve to lose money.\n\n\nThey don‚Äôt. They just listen to Joseph make up stuff and trust him. I think he‚Äôs points on his holdings are interesting and I like that he shows his portfolio...however he‚Äôs a dingbat when it comes to debunking dividend irrelevancy, and his followers just listen to him without actually reading about it. \n\n\n&gt; Yeah REITs are pretty great in that aspect, just gotta make sure the ETF you hold has REITs in the right places. I exclusively invest in REITs in my home country as I have a better understanding of trends and can react to changes faster.

This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).\n\nNet Income:\n\nNVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).\n\nSo what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue.

I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won‚Äôt move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel‚Äôs fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.', ""I don't think demand would collapse.

But there wasn\'t quite enough stuff for everybody at some point, and also fuck Steve, because Steve\'s a dick and he can\'t have any of these cool rocks I found or food from that cool tree I know about.\n\nSo, ownership isn\'t, like, an inherent physical trait of a thing. It\'s a matter of agreement, and frequently when this agreement can\'t be established, it\'s solved with pointy sticks/bioweapons/icbm\'s or whatever. It\'s cool; Steve was a dick and nobody misses him, and also he died back in the mists of prehistory and probably wasn\'t named that, but we don\'t respect him enough to think about it too hard.\n\nFrom ownership we get trade, the transfer of ownership, the agreement that ""I used to own this and you now own this and for whatever reason , that changed without either of us stabbing/nuking one another"", probably because Steve wasn\'t involved, so if anyone says that thing is mine because they were out of town when we agreed, I\'ll correct em! Because I\'m not Steve.\n\nand from trade we get money, an abstraction a bunch of people agreed on, because bartering is fucking tedious. Like steve. But what *is* money? It\'s..  just another agreement, right? But this one is less about trust in your neighbors about what goes where, and more like a religion. But a religion about people. It\'s faith that people will still think the thing is cool tomorrow. For a while, some of the first money was just barter goods that everybody always wanted, like salt or something else that keeps well and is necessary for life. But those things Cary from place to place, so if I from my prairie hut try to trade with some desert nomads and they try to pay me in salt, I\'m gonna be fucking pissed. So instead it was based on bullshit arbitrary things; lies a bunch of people bought into. Maybe that thing is shiny rocks, or the us government, or crappy math that draws more power than a mid sized nation. Whatever. But part of what makes a thing cool is other people liking it, right? So money is kind of also a popularity contest. And a religion. But it\'s convenient, so instead of getting rid of it we mostly just argue over which thing is cool instead of if this stuff is cool.\n\nStocks are... Okay so originally, they came with a percentage of the corporate income and stuff. But at some point that mostly stopped. Some stocks still pay dividends? But mostly not, and those are nothing compared to the potential profits from the natural churn, so most people don\'t really care. So it\'s mostly just money, but instead of dead ~~imperialist warlords and slavers~~ presidents, we get our favorite brands in the pieces of paper our numbers represent! Lowes! Nvidia! Enron! And also if you try to buy a pizza with it, it probably won\'t work.\n\nSo. At this point, the stock market is *a few* layers of abstraction outside of literally anything, right?

VONE and IWB use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark. SPYG and VOOG use the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to IWF, VONG and RWGV.\n\nIWM - for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nVXUS - Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I\'m not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nEEM - iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with VXUS. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\nEFA - This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**Sector fund ETFs:**\n\nICLN/TAN/FAN - These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you\'ll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\nARK group of funds: ARKG, ARKF, ARKK ARKW, ARKQ, PRNT and IZRL. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\nARKG - Genomic Revolution\n\nARKF - Fintech\n\nARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n\nARKW - Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n\nARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n\nPRNT - 3D printing technology\n\nIZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\nXLV - Health Care\n\nXLK - Technology\n\nXLY - Consumer Discretionary\n\nXLF - Financial\n\nXLE - Energy\n\nXLC - Communications\n\nXLG - S&amp;P Top 50\n\nXLI - Industrial\n\nXLP - Consumer Staples\n\nCLOUD COMPUTING: WCLD, SKYY, CLOU, BUG and XIKT.

I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\nEdit: The above was copied from a post I created several months ago. Some of the info may be a little out of date. This is not a comprehensive list.', '$AMC and $CRSR today, who‚Äôs with me?! Watching $NVDA for a nice rip on some calls as well.', '$AMC and $CRSR today, who‚Äôs with me?! Watching $NVDA for a nice rip on some calls as well.', 'Do you think Nvidia will tank a lot like Tesla when the stock split happens?', 'Does anyone knows what happens if one were to purchase stock after June 21st. Would you just have purchased one really expensive NVDA stock once the split happens.', 'If you were living in the UK, you would know by now that ARM will not be acquired by anyone, including Nvidia, Qualcomm or whatever. UK government stated clearly that it will oppose any form of acquisition.', ""I think this is a good start, and you're looking at some good things.  I don't personally tend to put too much weight into the Beta, P/B (I prefer earnings), specific cash flows (like investing and financing).  I like to look at the overall balance sheet to see if a company has cash to 1. cover their debts 2. make acquisitions and/or 3. invest in R/D and marketing to grow their market share.  Nvidia has a very strong balance sheet and their cash + cash equivalents far outpace their current liabilities.  This means they do have freedom to use their cash to either expand their business or pay a dividend.  \n\nVolume can be a good technical indicator as it gives you a feel for the overall short-term sentiment of the market, but I don't find it useful for fundamental analysis where I'm looking to hold a company for more than 3 years.\n\nThe P/E ratio being big is not necessarily a good thing - it is currently 85 for Nvidia.  This means for every 85 dollars you invest, the company will earn 1 dollar per year.  Obviously it's a moving statistic that changes with the price of the company and also with earnings increases/decreases, but it's a good snapshot in time.  Negative P/E means the company isn't profitable at all.  A low positive number, like 20, means the company is earning more money per dollar you invest in them.\n\nCompanies that expect to grow their earnings aggressively in the future will usually trade at a less favorable P/E ratio, because people are anticipating those higher future earnings.  The market is 'pricing in' the future growth of the company.  If the company continues to grow, you can see the stock price growth maintained, but if their growth stagnates then you can very quickly see the stock price collapse back towards a smaller P/E ratio (see what happened with Netflix this last quarter).\n\nSo, from what you've done so far I can decipher that Nvidia is profitable and their profit is growing pretty rapidly.  They have a strong amount of cash which I like.  Their current valuation is very aggressive, with a lot of future growth priced in (you see that in the P/B and P/E ratios).\n\nThe question to be asked, then, is will Nvidia continue to grow at a rate where their current valuation continues to expand.  To answer that, you would need to look at their business and the industry.  What sectors are Nvidia currently leading in?  Will those sectors grow?  Will Nvidia be able to expand market share in those sectors, or do they have any sort of competitive advantage in them that allow them to dominate?  Will Nvidia be able to maintain their profit margins, or do you see competitors rising and undercutting prices?  \n\nThese are all complex questions, which is why investing can be tricky.  You can see by the recent price increase in the stock that the market in general really likes the future prospects of the company.  Be careful with using market sentiment as your guiding principle, though - things can turn very quickly and you won't be out of a bad trade before the professionals will be.  All it takes is one quarter of bad guidance and the stock price could crater in post-market before you have the ability to react."", ""ARM deal will happen eventually.

Do you think there is an invisible force that this goes into?\n\n""Source, because you likely won‚Äôt believe me:""\n\nThis source is flawed majorly - the statements in it are true, but what you fail to understand is that it doesn\'t matter if stock ABC currently sitting at 100$ has 500 million asks and 500 million bids at 90$ and 110$ - it doesn\'t do jackshit if there is enough liquidity sitting between 100$ to 110$ and 100 to 90$. What your ""source"" references to is that whenever you have either more demand or more supply, it will move into the opposite direction because it\'s all about who breaks first, and more people mean it\'s more likely that this happens. **But that has literally nothing to do with shorting because what this talks about is owning shares and then selling them vs not owning shares and wanting to buy them, thus bid and ask.**\n\n&gt;Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you‚Äôre essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you‚Äôre sure will get filled.\n\nFalse. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can\'t take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL. THEY WORK TOGETHER.**\n\n&gt;Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.\n\nShort selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.\n\n&gt;‚ÄúShort sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company‚Äôs stock.‚Äù\n\nNo no no. Quote the entire thing:\n\n""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company‚Äôs stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company‚Äôs stock.""\n\nWhat you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.\n\n&gt;‚ÄúShort-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won‚Äôt last for long.‚Äù\n\nThank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years. You have the relation wrong. Shorts don\'t create a failing business, but a failing business creates shorts.\n\n&gt;I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.\n\nWhat the hell is this even meant to mean? Okay let\'s digest.\n\n""I am not saying shorts could bring a company down, unless the company was truly fraudulent.""\n\nWhat? What the hell do shorts have to do with whether the company is fraudulent or not? What hell of a point is that supposed to be?\n\nAnd second part:\n\n""I am not saying at all that shorts  could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved""\n\nYou what? Listen. A company doesn\'t give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn\'t matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated. But again, what you fail to imply is that a failing business causes shorts to come in, not shorts coming in cause a failing business. The topic of the post is still bankruptcy and no, shorts do not have an effect on the share price. Again, by your logic every long position that sells has the same negative effect because the share magically goes back to the market, meaning less supply. Which is simply wrong, someone else is buying it.\n\n**As a final word:**\n\nSupply and demand in shorts matters in 3 cases only:\n\n1. for algorithms. They use the spread to of bid and ask for high frequency trading. This actually does have a major impact on the trading volume, as well as the way it\'s going\n2. who of the bid ask sides breaks first. But bid and ask mostly long positions selling and non-positions buying. So that entire theory doesn\'t work out for reality.\n3. if the float of a stock is either close to or at 100% or the trading volume is insanely low. I\'ve been in stocks that I put up a MARKET ORDER and it wasn\'t closed for 3 months, so the end where no one is buying or at least enough to cover enough positions that mine is included. And the other end is of course that no one wants to sell.\n\nNone of these apply to short selling.', 'I\'ve started investing in the things that people recommended who were downvoted to shit . Most people in this sub and other investing/trading subs are legitimate idiots who have only gotten into the stock market in the past year, check their account history. So when I see someone downvoted for recommending people invest in something like VOO/VTI/QQQ or ""companies you KNOW"" instead of the Reddit hype stocks it meant something to me.\n\nSince then, I\'ve essentially dumped all my holdings and now only have 3 holdings in my portfolio. VTI, QQQ, and NVDA and couldn\'t be happier. I haven\'t looked at my portfolio in 4 months and I\'m up 45% on NVDA and ~7% on VTI/QQQ. They aren\'t insane gains but I would guarantee they\'re better than the majority of people dishing out investing advice here on Reddit.', 'Jesus Christ. This might be the most ill informed thing I have read on the history of the app.\n\nAddressing your first point:\n\nSelling a stock CERTAINLY decreases a stock‚Äôs price. The stock market is based on supply and demand. By selling, you increase the supply. No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock‚Äôs price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater. \n\n‚ÄúIf more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.‚Äù\n\nSource, because you likely won‚Äôt believe me: \n\nhttps://www.disnat.com/en/learning/trading-basics/stock-basics/what-causes-stock-prices-to-change\n\nAddressing your second point:\n\nAn imaginary number that doesn‚Äôt exist? \n\nThe current price is the most recent selling price of the stock, with adequate liquidity this number certainly isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù but instead a very good indicator of what you could buy or sell the stock for. If you want to ‚Äúmarket buy‚Äù you pay the ask, ‚Äúmarket sell‚Äù and you get the bid. Again, with enough liquidity these numbers, or the ‚Äúspread‚Äù should be very close to the ‚Äúcurrent price‚Äù or what you called ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù \n\nSource: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp\n\nYour third point:\n\nYes, buyers meet sellers and a exchange of shares goes through.\n\nYour NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you‚Äôre essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you‚Äôre sure will get filled. You don‚Äôt get to choose. If the last sale was at 299, your share is available at $300 but the market has people willing to sell at 298, 297, 296, 295 etc. do you ever think your $300 limit sell will get filled? Probably not, and thus why selling pressure increases supply and reduces the price (see point 1).\n\nYour fourth point:\n\nAgain referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price. \n\nTo quote the article you provided as evidence \n\n‚ÄúShort sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company‚Äôs stock.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShort-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won‚Äôt last for long.‚Äù\n\nI am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.
