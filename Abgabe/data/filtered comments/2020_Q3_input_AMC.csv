If you kick PLAY or AMC out of your property, you have a large, specialized facility or cruise ship to now fill. Knowing that quarantine will be lifted in the next few months. So buy NCLH, I did. Their lenders will be amenable, and they’ve been very public about the fact that right now things are tough but they’ve already booked up all of 2021.

I don't think the theaters are going away but the theater industry will continue to shrink and perhaps we're finally heading towards that Spielberg/Lucas discussion from years ago about where theaters are going. It's going to be mainly big movies and everything else goes direct to home. I'm going to guess Netflix found itself in a buyer's market this year with theaters shut and films looking to recoup production costs. How much smaller fare that would have gone to theaters in the past doesn't in the future? Netflix's original shows have actually been mostly good IMO; it's the original movies that were so awful.

I would fully expect them to make an almost 1:1 switch from revenue from green credits to being a battery supplier as other car manufacturers get into EVs.\n\nThat, all by itself, is why I think even $2k is cheap. [The race is now on to make bigger and bigger battery peaker plants](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ls-power-energizes-worlds-biggest-battery-near-san-diego-just-in-time-for-heatwave). Tesla got that ball rolling with Hornsdale and others are starting to see the opportunity.\n\nThey not only have best-in-class battery tech but industry-leading battery pack assembly. Sure, companies like Panasonic and LG produce cells to Tesla, GM and others but the real trick is how to quickly, efficiently and cheaply assemble those into quality power packs.\n\nIf this keeps going it makes more and more sense to go with wind/solar and battery for power. The batteries get better and bigger and power supply more reliable. The economics of it are at the very least far more stable than the roller coaster ride of fossil fuel prices and potentially far more profitable. That's why comparisons to GM, Ford or whoever makes no sense. Put them up against Saudi Aramco or BP. That's who they're after next."", 'I doubt AMC is going anywhere so I bought into them a few months ago, last time I checked they had decent financials for weathering the storm.

2020-08-25,"[""Wall to wall superhero trash gets asses in seats. And now we're at the summer blockbuster hits with Tenet and New Mutants. Tenet already made a mil in just Korea. I'm gonna guess AMC hits $7 then slowly drops"", 'I\'m more in the u/Meymo camp. I think this is a very bifurcated recovery of winners and losers and I think the longer this goes on, the more you\'re going to potentially see changing consumer behaviors/habits become ingrained and will be a tailwind for certain industries/themes (e-comm, telehealth, digital payments, etc.) Retail giants and restaurant chains gain share unfortunately while mom and pops/Main Street loses. There have been some discussions by the chains of great real estate becoming available and you have to imagine that a lot of that is mom/pop places going away.\n\n  Money hasn\'t been put under the mattress nearly to the degree that I thought it would during this; I think it was astonishing that earlier this year Williams Sonoma (which certainly is not something that is recession-friendly) had positive comps during a quarter where their stores were closed for more than half the quarter. People are buying RVs right and left. Money that would have been spent on apparel and other things is being spent on home. Money that would have been spent on travel by plane is being spent traveling by car or RV (""staycations"".)  RVs are doing incredibly well, but even a Polaris is doing well with their vehicles.\n\n People are moving  - moving out of cities, moving rural (positive for Tractor Supply), etc. I think there are people who probably think that this will pass and it will but the longer it goes on and the more people move out of an area, I think the holdouts eventually start to leave too. Redfin and Zillow are talking about a remarkable amount of people buying houses virtually during this (tons of people buying houses ""sight unseen"" certainly not something I think a lot of people could have imagined years ago.)\n\nThere\'s debates about NYC - even Seinfeld wrote an article the other day trying to defend the city\'s future. VNO and SLG remain near the lows and it will be interesting to see if those recover - if a couple of years have gone by and those haven\'t gone anywhere, I think that\'ll be very concerning.\n\nThings like RH, Home Depot, Lowes and even something like Scott\'s Miracle Gro benefit as people continue to move and emphasize their home. Depending on how the current crisis plays out, perhaps people continue to look at their home differently and some of the emphasis on spending to create home comfort continues on and there\'s less spending elsewhere.  Lowes noted in the earnings PR that some of their remarkable growth in the last quarter is coming from ""wallet share shift away from other discretionary spending."" And that\'s certainly the case: I think what you\'re seeing in retail winners (Home Depot and Lowes with 20-30%+ comps, which is remarkable) is because that money isn\'t being spent elsewhere (apparel, etc.) People aren\'t spending on A and B, so C is getting the spending emphasis. While I think some restaurant chains that are prepared for digital are doing well, I\'ll guess a lot of people are continuing to eat at home (perhaps part of the Buffett reasoning for the Kroger position?)\n\nIf this becomes a more home-focused population for a while even after this is over, then home entertainment continues to win. Video games, Netflix, Roku, Peloton/Lululemon\'s Mirror instead of going to fitness class, etc. Out of the house entertainment (particularly movie theaters; you\'ve already seen the deal with Universal and AMC to shorten the theatrical window) loses. E-commerce wins (and anything that powers businesses selling online) /convenience wins (Target\'s Drive-Up Pick Up had 734% growth last quarter and they\'re expanding the service sooner than thought.) Any retailer that was already in decline before this has seen that decline accelerate and additionally, I think you already were seeing consolidation of shopping before this crisis. Now if people are going to go get something, they really probably want to get everything in one place. Problem for specialty retail/department stores. I think the outdoor shopping center with need-based anchors is going to be an okay business going forward. I think the indoor mall where Gap and Macy\'s are anchors is going to be a terrible business going forward and a lot of malls are going to have to be repurposed.\n\nTech and other growth that is less impacted or benefits from this has seen basically a stampede into it. A quote from a Bloomberg article a couple of weeks ago: ""Going by this logic, the market, consciously or otherwise, is doing more than just adjusting for a brutal but brief economic interruption. Rather, it’s repricing itself for a more profoundly altered reality -- a world in which the urge to limit human interaction squeezes the old economy mercilessly while hastening the ascent of a digital and mostly automated new one."" (https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/nasdaq-valuations-say-you-ll-be-stuck-at-home-for-a-long-time)\n\nI think there\'s been a lot of pulling forward of growth for many tech companies and many of them have said as much, many of them I think have tailwinds from this. That said, when you have growth funds up 60-70% YTD and it\'s August, is some degree of that already well reflected? I think so and that\'s why I trimmed (sold some, kept rest) a number of aggressive growth names a couple weeks or so ago. Additionally, whereas SaaS anything has been a winner this year, this quarter you\'re starting to see some cracks form and a bit of separation between winners and losers. Atlassian, for example: ""Fiscal 2021 will be a challenging year. We will lean into the headwinds we face as a business, and be bold as we push through the turbulence."" So I think in enterprise tech spending you\'re probably going to see people have to be more choosy and figure out what is more mission critical. \n\nI think there\'s going to be businesses that are going through some bumps during this that will be more relevant in the years to come. Ecolab is an example; that company discussed on the Q1 conference call about how hand sanitizer in lobbies of buildings or stores really started after H1N1 - before that, it didn\'t exist. Post-corona, how many more places are going to have sanitizer and additional sanitation/hygiene practices that they didn\'t previously? Solid, consistent business for years and I think probably going to be a solid, consistent business for years to come.\n\nRates are low and companies that can smartly use that to their advantage are going to benefit.\n\nSo I think what has interested me during this (and I think I\'ve thought more about my investments during this than I have in the last few years) is really the winners and losers (and whether some losers are going to be to some degree permanently impaired - will some % of business travel not come back and be virtual?), habits that will potentially change to some degree for good (the rise of telehealth/remote monitoring, etc) and more.\n\nI\'m not saying that things are great by any means. Things are fragile. But post March low you\'ve basically seen a stampede into much of the new economy while the old economy names have lagged (and yesterday Exxon gets booted from the Dow while Salesforce is in) and while there are people on here who seem to want to believe everything is bad, some companies have done quite well/benefited throughout this. I think looking long-term,  many of those companies will continue to. The question for me short-term is whether we\'re near a point where everyone is on one side of the boat (growth.) Again, things also remain fragile. We\'ve seen multiple rotations lasting a few days this year and it would really surprise me if there\'s not a more significant one at some point. If there was a solution to the current crisis tomorrow, you\'d see a considerable rotation.\n\nI did trim a lot of high growth (particularly SaaS) a couple of weeks or so ago but a lot of that has already been re-deployed, just into different growth themes and names that are somewhat slower/slower growth after buying a lot of/putting more emphasis on high growth in March/early April. I have a long-term view and I don\'t intend to not be invested/be heavily in cash, but given how well this year has gone investing-wise, I thought it prudent to dial down the aggressive growth after dialing it up in March/April.\n\nSo, not bearish, but I do think that some aggressive growth is overextended.  The problem becomes a lot of the ""impacted"" sectors don\'t look all that appealing, either. I\'ve called out medical devices as something of interest - a SYK isn\'t as appealing as it was when I discussed it towards the lows, but it\'s still down for the year and I think that\'s a business where demand has been really simply delayed. A lot of elective procedures have been cancelled/delayed because of what\'s going on but eventually old people will get knee replacements. There\'s certainly others, too - and that\'s not saying that this sector will bounce back tomorrow by any means, but unlike some other sectors that are impacted, these are needs that have been delayed, not wants.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Monitoring what companies are saying. What are consumer companies saying about spending? What are software companies saying about their customers and desire to spend? etc.\n\n2.  The longer this crisis goes on, what are the long-term impacts even post-crisis? What habits are going to change to some degree permanently - and in that case, who wins, who loses? Will the losers see some % of their business not come back?\n\nSo those are the two things I\'m focused on really. What are companies saying and the longer this goes on, how much to consumer habits/behaviors change to some degree permanently/for a very long time after this is over?']"
