This is further above the average than has been typical during the last two years.\n* Investors in low quality junk bonds are accepting 2.20 percentage points in additional yield over safer investment grade corporate bonds. While this spread is historically low, it is sharply higher than recent levels and suggests that investors are becoming more risk averse.\n* Stocks have outperformed bonds by 1.17 percentage points during the last 20 trading days. However, this is close to the weakest performance for stocks relative to bonds in the past two years and indicates investors are starting to flee risky stocks for the safety of bonds.\n* The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is at 37.21 and indicates that investors remain concerned about declines in the stock market. \n\n# Hypothesis 2\n\n**The market has been through a change in the administration, and historically the January drift has a few bumps on election years**, this is nothing to worry about and you can probably ignore the drama going on safely. \n\n### Evidence \n\n* Since 1930, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of 10.0% in a president\'s first year and 7.9% in the second, [YCharts data](https://go.ycharts.com/how-presidential-elections-impact-the-stock-market-guide).\n* This could be a [bear trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp), as things have been going well (relatively) with the new administration, and people who have been through trauma are primed to prepare for another tragedy sometimes prophetically. \n* JPOW didn\'t increase rates, AAPL crushed their earnings, TSLA crushed their earnings, FB even did well. \n\n\n# Hypothesis 3\n\n**Reddit using a company with a market cap of 10-20 billion (1/87th of the size of tesla) some how busted one or more hedge funds**... and some how organized the entire internet in a grand David vs Goliath story battling it out and the market is going to crash as a result. \n\n### Evidence \n\n* strangers on the internet told me on discord\n* CNBC ran a story setting up this narrative in prime time slots\n* just trust me bro', 'Its not to late to invest into AMC.', ""Sorry, your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l6rocu/what_are_your_thoughts_on_amc_and_nok_for_today/) in /r/stocks has been automatically removed due to Rule 3:  Low effort.\n\nIf you just want to post 1 liners or just want to know everyone's thoughts, then post a comment to our daily discsusion thread which are generally stickied or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/), and **especially** [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) **which aggregates the most news for almost every stock**.\n\nIf instead you're wondering what a term means, go to Investopedia.com and search for said term there.\n\nEither way come back here to repost with your findings, thanks!\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme\n\nIf you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -&gt; 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.\n\nShares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to &lt;200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!\n\nAdditionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally.

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM)\n\nThe regular trading process:\n\n1. A customer buys a stock/option from a brokerage (which is the platform/customer side of the market)\n2. The brokerage sends the information to DTC (basically the custodian and the clearinghouse) DTCC usually requires a collateral of 1-3% of the transaction. This means that if you buy a stock worth $100, your brokerage buys the stock from DTCC for $3 (as a long), since it takes about 1-3 days for the cash to settle.\n3. Once the transacation is completed you obtain your shares instantly, but the brokerage will have to send the remaining money 97-99% within 2 business days.\n\nWhat happened to GME, AMC, and etc.\n\n1. The trade volume skyrocketed and volatility skyrocketed.\n2. DTCC became scared and raised the collateral requirement to 100%, basically 33x the capital to DTCC.\n3. Assuming the trade volume as of 1/28/2021, 177.8 million shares, that means that the brokerage must now send hundreds of billions of dollars to DTCC every single large trades. DTCC does not have the capital to support it. Melvin Capital does not have the capital to support this.\n4. What happens when Melvin Capital goes bankrupt and can\'t pay for the shorts? Answer: DTCC is obligated to pay for it. Basically making DTCC go bankrupt. What happens when DTCC goes bankrupt, that means the entire US stock market trading goes to a standstill. DTCC has a monopoly of 95% of total US stock trading (according to Webull CEO).\n5. That doesn\'t even take into account the options.\n\nWhat does this mean: the current market system does not allow such a large number of financial transactions to occur in such a short period and time. In addition, there is a conflict of interest, since DTCC does not want Melvin Capital to go completely bankrupt, since then DTCC might go bankrupt.\n\n1st question you might have: Why does DTCC exist? Answer: when you buy a stock, you buy the street price and not the person quoted price. Otherwise, we could see volatility in the 50%+ forever with the transactions of stocks, since buying would raise the price and selling would lower the price even with a small transactions.\n\n2nd question: What would happen if they don\'t raise collateral cost? In 2008, Lehman Brothers was like DTCC, they did not raise it fast enough. Basically, the hedge funds that used Lehman Brothers could not sell/buy, since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. This causes a complete market breakdown.\n\n3rd question: Why was Robinhood only allowing selling and not buying? Selling does not require collateral, so that would have been fine. Problem is that it only benefits the shirt-sellers, so they probably should have followed Webull and just halted trading completely.\n\n4th question: What is the worst case scenario? GME keeps rising and it takes a hedge fund completely down, say Melvin Capital. Clearing House DTC will now liquidate other brokerages to cover the short. What are these other brokerages, basically all the banks and all the other brokerages like M1 finance, Robinhood, Webull and etc. This will cause those companies to sell other shares of the market and then cause GME to rise. Basically, it is an infinite money glitch that somehow was allowed in the market. \n\n**TDLR:** WSB + social media + other hedge funds (definitely some players got into this) almost caused the entire US stock market to halt ALL trading, so the clearinghouse basically changed the rules to prevent that from happening. Basically, they sided with the ""suits""/""wallstreet"", since they could have caused a financial meltdown..........LMAO', 'So are we holding AMC?', 'Per Ortex: estimated short interest on AMC is 63M shares vs last reported exchange data of 44.7M.

Here’s something to consider.\n\n[WSB will not allow me to post since I’m less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]\n\nI love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here’s why:\n\nThere were 50M trades today. Retail investors couldn’t buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys today, that’s 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.\n\nDoes that mean the price won’t go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it’ll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who’ll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who’ve likely already exited their positions.\n\nThis is all theory. I hope I’m proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don’t think they’d want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.\n\nWelcome your thoughts. But please don’t pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people’s money is at stake here.\n\nPS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I’m prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.\n\nPS2: Please get the hell out of Robinhood.

The most recent report was short interest as of Jan 15 which is **226.42%** of shares float increased from Dec-31 of 140%. This is because shares can be shorted more than once. - [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\nToday, 9,606,123 new shorts were entered. It\'s not completely evident how many were covered but some paid services provide live estimates/data of current short interest. The short volume was in line with Tuesday\'s percentage of 16.89%. That is out of 58,494,600 shares exchanged today, 16.89% were shares that were shorted (sold on margin). This indicates an increasing short interest not decreasing. - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).\n\nThe days to cover is really just an estimate of how quickly all the shorts *could* cover their positions by taking the short interest (number of shares shorted) by the average daily volume. Because the volume has been increasing higher for GME this makes it seem like the ""days to cover"" - 2.81 may seem like the short position is declining but it actually indicates the opposite. I would expect this to be less than 1 when the short squeeze is underway (e.g. less short interest / average volume). - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp). This number is **extremely** **high** vs TSLA with a ratio of 1.09 or AAPL 0.88. This **high** number represents that the short squeeze is ready to hit at any moment but we are far from there.\n\nAt this point, the shorts think this is a fad and it will just fade away and so just keep re-entering to not only cover their loss but to earn profit off it\'s rise. They view that they haven\'t lost anything that can\'t be re-earned and aren\'t afraid of WSB army. Any fake news that say all shorts have exited is completely and 100% false.\n\nIn reality, the days to cover will actually be much more because shares have been shorted **more than twice**. A position to close takes 2 days. So at most, only half of the short positions could be submitted for close in a given day and then it would require 2 days for those shares to be returned to their rightful owners at which point the 100% of the 120% would be able to exit requiring another 2 days to settle leaving 20% short interest. The second half of the short will be totally and utterly fucked.\n\nWhile I\'m sure many tried to exit today at the drop of $125 if they shorted yesterday and many probably entered at today\'s high, it\'s clear that more has been entered via a ladder strategy - 100 shares @ $250, 100 shares @ $240, etc. dropping the price instantaneously but while this is intended to create fear it just exposed risk even more. So the shorts that were entered &lt; $250 are now really screwed and either have to keep putting up more and more margin or cover their position.\n\nI wouldn\'t be surprised if this continues well into next week or the week after. Wall Street has deep pockets and when the stock rises 100% - 300% in 1 day (e.g. like AMC and GMC), someone has to pony up that money to ensure the short position can actually be covered and if the people who borrowed the margin can\'t, the clearing firms members (the brokers) have to (hence why RH and WeBull had to halt trading because it became so expensive to the shorts that they, the brokers, were becoming liable).\n\nThis momentum took off way faster and higher than anyone could have imagined going up over 10x in 5 days (from last Friday to today\'s high).\n\nI think for this to continue, it will have to have more modest consistent gains, 20-30% per day, because 100%+ jumps creates massive margin calls that the shorts can\'t fund quickly and so the trades at are risk of settling meaning the brokers have to be deep pocketed enough to cover the greedy suits.\n\nIf large jumps continue, trading will halt again. The margin requirements should be increased to 300-400% for any new positions and I think some are doing this but it appears that RH and WeBull\'s clearing house was exposed to a lot of risk of the suits not being able to cover such quick increases over night literally.', 'Don’t have enough free cash for gme so bought some amc. I wonder if everyone selling their positions on robinhood will drop the market', ""💎THEY TRIPLED DOWN ON AMC SHORTING 💎 \n\nWhy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: \n\nTake a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme\n\nIf you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -&gt; 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.\n\nShares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to &lt;200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!\n\nAdditionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.\n\n🚀🚀🚀\n\nTHEY WANNA SHUT US DOWN ON ROBINHOOD, WE AINT BACKING DOWN.

I am seeing a lot of information flying around accusing brokerages of blocking retail traders from buying with the express intent of screwing retail investors. Here\'s another, more rational take, coming from an associate of mine who works on Wall Street:\n\n* In the US, there is one central securities depository called the Depository Trust Company (DTC).\n* When you buy a stock on Robinhood, they take the order to DTC. DTC fills the order by finding a seller. The same thing happens when a hedge fund wants to buy securities, or a bank.\n* However, there is risk associated with matching a buyer to a seller. To mitigate this risk, there is something called the ""settlement cycle""\n* The settlement cycle is a 2-day holding period where the buyer (in this case, your broker) puts down a clearing fund deposit to collateralize the transaction. After the two days, they get the deposit back.\n\nSo what\'s happening here?\n\nThe clearing fund deposit that buyers have to submit is adjusted based on market volatility. Because of the volatility surrounding $GME, $AMC, and these other stocks, the clearinghouses/DTC are requiring firms to front excessively high collateral in order to buy shares of these companies.\n\nMany of these brokers like Robinhood simply just may not have the cash on to front the collateral to fulfill the massive influx of buy orders incoming for these stocks. So they suspended accepting buy orders for the stocks. They kept the option of selling open, because they have a fiduciary duty towards their customers. Their actions are a byproduct of not having enough money to fulfill the orders.\n\nWhy can hedge funds and big banks buy then? Because they have plenty of cash lying around! And if they don\'t, they can borrow it from each other. Because of this, they don\'t have to worry about being locked out of the markets due to volatility.\n\nIn summary: please don\'t jump to conclusions and assume bad faith before it is proven.

GME and AMC stock is not the war, it's only a battle. The cat is out of the bag, and people up and down the globe are starting to realise that with a co-ordinated effort with a community of enough small-time investors through zero commission apps, they can they drive the price of a stock upwards or downwards. Of course, there is an argument that this is market manipulation, but this is an unprecedented situation in more ways than one:\n\n1. The trading apps that brokers like Robinhood, Trading 212 have given power to small time investors. Anyone can purchase options on their phone at their own discretion.\n2. It was never considered by Wall Street and the stock market investment firms that internet communities like WSB could co-ordinate in such a way. If investment firms did this, then it would be 100% illegal, but the stocks are being held by ordinary people owning between thousands of shares to a single share, themselves, there's no illegality about this at all.\n3. At present there are no regulations/laws that say that this isn't legal. No doubt the fat cats and hedge funders will be calling for some, but it could also be argued that hedge funds shorting stocks are no different, or worse. The aggressive shorting they participate in drives stock markets down. With enough capital they to borrow and sell stocks for shorting, they are manipulating stocks themselves. Do they really want to throw stones in a glass house. It has to be a fair game. If WSB can't do it, then the hedge funders shouldn't be allowed to either.\n4. To make things even more controversial, there is an obvious conflict of interest with apps like Robinhood and Trading 212. The fact they've decided to stop allowing people to buy meme stock like Gamestop, Nokia, American Airlines etc. today was a blatant effort to stop small time investors from buying more stock whilst the hedge funders were still allowed to drive the stock down. It's obvious market manipulation, but again, this is unprecedented. These apps that have removed barriers for small investors are a relatively young concept, so it could be argued that current option buying regulations/laws are not suitable for the concept of apps like Robinhood. To make matters more interesting, companies like Citadel have an interest in making them work. So at what point does someone discuss that trading apps should be banned? \n5. Now politicians and public figures have openly come out and spoken against the behaviour of the decision to prohibit small investors buying more stock. Lawsuits are being filed. The white house is monitoring the situation. Something has to crack. What side will the government take and will they intervene? Personally I can't see Biden's administration taking a stance either way, because either they piss of the fat cats, or they take the side of Wall Street (which I doubt would be a popular move).

Don\'t get me wrong, I invested in GME back in December and took my profits, but now you have hundreds of thousands of people flooding into the investing market looking to make a quick buck off of GME and AMC -- if you want to gamble, go to a casino.\n\nGameStop and AMC now have raised plenty of capital to pull themselves away from bankruptcy, (yay we saved two great companies looking to turn themselves around!) and the hedge funds have been bled of 10-25% of their capital. I\'m pretty sure they\'ve learned their lesson. Now we just need to hold the SEC accountable for implementing regulations against hedge funds.\n\nSo many investors who have been slowly learning and enjoying making steady gains on the market this past year are growing frustrated with this new ""hive mind"" of retail investors running around ""wHaT wE gOnNa pUmP nExT gUyS?!?!""\n\nThat\'s not how this stuff works.

Many new bankers were giving people advice, the flight from the krone governing all transactions.""\n\n""the large numbers of unemployed, their passions fermented by the Communists, are seething with discontent ... a mob has attempted to set the Parliament building on fire.""\n\nSound a little familiar...? the Weimar Republic at the time was also going through a stretch of bipartisan Political extremism. We\'ve also been printing money like crazy. I dont know about you, but I don\'t want to see our country\'s financial system collapse.\n\nTo the people trying to trigger an infinite squeeze so they can bleed the entire market dry into their pockets -- this makes them NO better than the hedge funds who did it to our country in 2008-2009.\n\nLastly, the CEO of Citadel, look him up -- I would NOT be surprised if the GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze was a Ch1n35e psy-op to get us to collapse our entire stock market.

TO THE MOON 🌙', '--------------------------------------------------------\n1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: \n\nWhen you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.\n\nEnter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers &amp; buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the ""title"" for your shares, the folks who make it official.\n\n**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy\'s trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn\'t enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It\'s simply not enough.\n\nIn addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you\'re on your own; we ain\'t gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you\'re not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don\'t even know exists.\n\nSo, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn\'t enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they\'re on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there\'s a ""failure to deliver""? \n\n---------------------------\n\n2) **Failure to Deliver**:\n\nThis is a pretty fucking big deal. Bigger than you imagine, because it\'s basically a slam-dunk law suit. \n\nFailure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there\'s no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn\'t enough for everyone. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n3) **Liability**: \n\nYou must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it\'s not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn\'t even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug.\n\nHence: Bad Decision &gt; Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad\'s mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)\n\n\nI personally don\'t believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there\'s definitely coordination all around, but occam\'s razor says this is not such an ordeal.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nCouple of semi-related notes:\n\n-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.\n\n-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it\'s such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?\n\n\n-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. \n\n- **TL;DR**: There\'s simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.\n\n- **What will happen now**: Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there\'s not enough float, I\'m guessing up up up up up.\n\nExplanation from u/Only-Tells-The-Truth', ""As a general rule for first time investors, stick with low risk low reward portfolios.

The hedge funds took the advantage to super manipulate in ways god know what, and to show us how it works. Same thing with today, super low volume within the 20 mill range, gme significantly drops in value to low 200’s with no moving trades. If you looked at around morning to noon, all ask and bids were shares of 100s mostly the hfs trading back and forth to manipulate the price down as they’d like. So right now we are doing well, not giving in much as before and holding the priceAs long as we hold off in the $250-$350 range, the squeeze willl come very very soon. And yes 1k is definitely possible, and so can 5k and 10k limits. Right now the shorter are losing millions a day holding their position, while we pay nothing but time. As time awaits the shorts will eventually have to give in, from margin call or near bankruptcy and commit to buying shares at the price we can surge it upwards too. It will become a domino effect,- AS LONG as we can’t maintain the support level and holding onto our shares- once one or few hfs give in, the prices will soar as they are recouping shares they borrowed, meaning other hedge funds with near position will give in as the price will raise and they will get called on or will cover, same to all hfs. We recently had big sharks joining on with us, Congress and the sec by us retail investors, and billionaires defending us, the world is gaining attention to gme as China and Europe in pouring in and holding well off the limits to help keep the support of gme and to all soon takeoff🚀. Liek I said, there can’t be no way the short interest is below 100% as of now and no way they covered and exited, they are in a bad position right now thus paying ads and diverting attention away from gme to go into other hype stocks like slv bb nok and amc. We know what we are to be up against and we should continue to hold. They will give in very soon, just can’t predict as long as we can hold it off. We will take off shortly', 'Sell AMC $4 puts for 3/19 for an easy 20% gain. I doubt AMC dips below 4 after getting rid of a lot of debt.

As long as they enter into the rally with a sizeable position to cover their short and short at the peak, they can make back the cost of covering their shares.\n\nI now believe that's what happened to GME and AMC on Wednesday.  Those massive spike in GME and AMC price and volume was the shorts buying shares into the rally and pumping it.  Then when they knew they had an advantage on balance of their cost average, shorted again at like 450.\n\nHence the drop in GME and AMC.  How did they know 450 was the price to short?

But there needs to be a lasting change for it to stop burning cash.', 'Given what happened to GME today, I’d like to add a few thoughts. People are questioning what next. There are many people holding the bag and I feel for you. However, I think we have a few possibilities from here:\n\n1) Remember robinhood still has large restrictions on GME. So like Mark Cuban has said, the demand for the stock has been curbed, it might be likely to see additional demand when all restrictions are lifted.\n\n2) Finra releases the numbers on Feb. 9th, and we don’t need to speculate over SI being 50% or not, we can know the actual amount. Plus, I’m sure there are additional shorts yesterday and today. What if the numbers are still over 100% ? Would there be additional demand for GME at that point ? \n\n3) Some say the short squeeze is over, if it is over, I don’t think GME is a bad investment. Remember that ryan Cohen is an activist investor known for turning businesses around. He recognizes the need for a shift in the business model. I think the GME members realize it and are receptive to him. I think there’s value to this, and I plan to buy more when there are discounts even if the short squeeze is over. Also, there is tremendous growth in the video game industry, and I think Ryan Cohen will be able to take advantage of this. I believe he is a smart investor and I certainly believe in him. \n\nI’m personally holding at 152 per share and I would buy more as the dips continue perhaps when it goes to double digits. Remember that the stock did pop to Jan 11th, when the short squeeze wasn’t announced. There are also additional fundamental analysis by u/DeepFuckingValue, and so although it certainly hurts to see these red days, I feel that there are reasons to keep the stock regardless of whether the squeeze is over or not. So think twice about cutting your losses.\n\nHowever, I did cut my losses for AMC, they have an EPS of -34 and I don’t think I can argue for much value there. I’d rather be invested in a company like Cinemax which only has an eps of -1.4ish. But I don’t feel the same for GME.\n\nHappy to get other perspectives and insights as well.', 'So what is the deal with AMC? SELL OR HOLD?', '1000$ in amc calls turned to 12k and jumped ship immediately when it peaked', ""I'm new to this too, and, as WSB would put it, I had paper hands and got out of my AMC position yesterday at a loss of only a few dollars (total, not per share). I'll try to give my understanding of it without any of the childish meme-y WSB lingo...\n\n&gt;I see there are 44 million shares shorted. And they will have to buy those back. But when?\n\nThe thing with the shorts is that they can put it off as long as they can afford to by paying interest on the shares. So it's a game of chicken over who can hold out longer... the retail investors holding the shares or hedge funds staying solvent while paying the interest on their shorts and waiting until the price drops enough.\n\n&gt;And why the huge price dip?\n\nThe commonly accepted theory based on the lack of trading volume is that it was a short ladder attack. That's when the hedge funds buy and sell their shares back and forth from each other at lower and lower prices. That creates an artificial share price drop. Pair that with Robinhood and others freezing out their retail investors from buying more shares, and on paper, it looks like people are selling and the price falls off a cliff. That artificial price drop was meant to scare retail investors into selling, thus lowering the amount of short.\n\n&gt;WSB is saying hold hold hold, but is that still smart? Why or why not?\n\nDepends on how many people are cashing out today with the new round of short ladder attacks. As stated above, I got spooked enough to cash out of AMC, and I never got into GME because like this post said, I felt like I missed the boat with GME and would get caught holding the bag like the (likely) poor schmucks that bought in at +300. If enough people hold, a short squeeze can still come. If not, GME and all the other stocks will tumble back down to a more realistic valuation. Like others in here have said, I think there's reason to be bullish on AMC if you sit on it until movie theaters are back to full capacity business, but I don't think anyone who bought at like 16 a share will get back in the black in the next month or two.

And that is not because of DD, but despite it.\n\nAMC faces pretty strong headwinds still from Covid and streaming, and wasn't the healthiest anyway. NOK hasn't shown itself to be a great company for some time, and while there are opportunities because of politics, politics are fickle.

And Nokia has some pretty serious competition in the 5G space.\n\nIf you look at the AMC price two years ago, it is easy to assume it will climb back to that, and maybe it will, but there is a significant chance that a changed world will mean that AMC won't get to that price again for a LONG TIME. And if it does, you could well have missed out on other opportunities.

But now I've gained enough awareness to even *look* at things like that, to pay more attention.\n\nNo matter is the squeeze gets squoze or not, there's been some good out of all this."", ""I'm new to this too, and, as WSB would put it, I had paper hands and got out of my AMC position yesterday at a loss of only a few dollars (total, not per share). I'll try to give my understanding of it without any of the childish meme-y WSB lingo...\n\n&gt;I see there are 44 million shares shorted. And they will have to buy those back. But when?\n\nThe thing with the shorts is that they can put it off as long as they can afford to by paying interest on the shares being on loan. So it's a game of chicken over who can hold out longer... the retail investors holding the shares or hedge funds staying solvent while paying the interest on their shorts and waiting until the price drops enough.\n\n&gt;And why the huge price dip?\n\nThe commonly accepted theory based on the lack of trading volume is that it was a short ladder attack. That's when the hedge funds buy and sell their shares back and forth from each other at lower and lower prices. That creates an artificial share price drop. Pair that with Robinhood and others freezing out their retail investors from buying more shares, and on paper, it looks like people are selling and the price drops. That artificial price drop was meant to scare retail investors into selling, thus lowering the amount of short.\n\n&gt;WSB is saying hold hold hold, but is that still smart? Why or why not?\n\nDepends on how many people are cashing out today with the new round of short ladder attacks. As stated above, I got spooked enough to cash out of AMC, and I never got into GME because like this post said, I felt like I missed the boat with GME and would get caught holding the bag like the (likely) poor schmucks that bought in at +300. If enough people hold, a short squeeze can still come. If not, GME and all the other stocks will tumble back down to a more realistic valuation. Like others in here have said, I think there's reason to be bullish on AMC if you sit on it until movie theaters are back to full capacity business, but I don't think anyone who bought at like 16 a share will get back in the black in the next month or two. But you could say the exact same thing about any of its competitors like Cinemark.\n\nObligatory, I'm not a financial advisor and these are just my, possibly uneducated, observations of the whole thing."", ""I bought some BB, AMC, and NOK before they jumped, but stayed out of GME.\n\nI didnt spend more than I'd feel alright setting on fire, and i bought those companies because i genuinely believe they have long term potential (AMC once theaters reopen, BB once they stsrt getting used in most smart cars, and NOK because of their upcoming tech).\n\nBut yeah if you YOLO tens of thousands in meme stock (or even worse, the shit pile that is dogecoin) dont be surprised when youre the one left holding the bag"", '*not a financial advisor*\n\nI’m with OP and the top comments on this.

Typically its used when you are up; say you bought at 15 and its currently at 18. You dont want to sell now because it may still be goint up but want to ensure you make some profit incase it goes down. Set your Stop Loss at 17 so you still profit 2/share, but you can still sell when its at 18 if you feel its stagnant/going to go down. \n\nLimits are very helpful when you are buying. I have been setting my limits about a dollar or two less than open because as of late, stocks are dropping for the first two hours following open and then gradually increase between 1030-130. Say a stock opens at 15 and you are expecting that decline before the hype of the market picks up. Set your limit to purchase at 14 so you get in during the dip and slowly watch where it goes from there.

Really this post is just a grim reminder to myself to not be so stupid again. Just like everyone else I got sucked in with the FOMO and hype - diamond hands and all that BS is just people (most likely unintentionally) trying to keep you on board and funding yourself on a sinking ship which they believe will go well to fuel both yours and their confirmation bias.\n\nSome back story: I'm a 19-year-old university student and relatively new investor (I had been thinking about getting into it for a while and some of my friends had brokerage accounts too. I set up my t212 account about in mid-December) but have had a vanguard account since early November.\n\nI initially bought into GME at $120 with about £40 and then after the first big dip and bounce back I quite unfortunately bought at the second peak stupidly thinking it'd go further and that's where it went tits up. The massive drop lost 70% of about £500 that I had put in - but now it's gone. That drop has stressed me out for the last few days - I know everyone says don't put in what you cant afford to lose and that's correct, I could afford to lose it but it still sucks nonetheless and in hindsight, it would've been far better sat inside my vanguard life strategy fund or in the s&amp;p500.\n\nI suppose what I've learned is that [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) is now a cult and you shouldn't listen to their shit at all because 95% of the time its a shit idea - I could've pulled out earlier with minimal losses but I didn't because I felt brainwashed with their stupid diamond hands shite and that perhaps it'll bounce back to $1000 or fucking Jupiter. I now personally don't think it will and even if it does go to $1000 I don't think I'll be too mad that I've pulled away now - If it worked out it really would've just made me complacent and I would've just gambled more of my money on Wall Streets excellent Ponzi scheme machine.\n\nSome of WSB's DD is great and some of it sucks and its a real skill to remove any biases you might have to look at stocks and their DD with a level head and pick the good from the bad.\n\nThis could seem a bit political so mods tell me if I should remove it this part. I think WSB is a real social phenomenon and it's really shown me how echo chambers work (I always was confused to how things such as Tr\\*mp and M\\*GA could get so crazy that it leads to an insurrection and I think WSB has ended up in a sense a bit as Parler did where a lot of people with one certain ideology talk freely about the wacky shit they believe and everybody else agrees with them and it only gets worse. At this point, I feel that because WSB users call for bans as soon as somebody disagrees with their point of view and when people that believe that GME, BB, AMC is a terrible idea getting downvoted to fuck makes them avoid commenting there (although even if they do it'll never get to the front page of the sub). Perhaps I've missed the point but WSB is now a circlejerk-y cesspit of echochambering where no other opinions are really getting aired. That said some DD is excellent for the long term strategy of the company with Cohen's large stake and his success of Chewy I think it will do very well, but it's absolutely not $1000+ stock and probably won't stretch $250 in the long term without some major overhauls with eccomerce in the future. But that's my hottake and I should've come to that conclusion about 3 weeks ago before committing to this crazy rollercoaster.\n\nFrom now on I'll be doing my own DD (if I ever return to day trading) and blocking out WSB's madness - nobody needs that betting in their lives and I'm going to break the cycle for myself before doing any more dumb shit. After my withdrawn money is back in my bank account I'll be closing my T212 account and putting the leftover money back into Vanguard (perhaps just use the t212 practice accounts for some fun to get my human gambling fix). I feel like a massive fucking moron for what I've done and I'm glad I didn't put any more into it than I did but I still feel sick to the stomach.\n\nLuckily I'll be making my money back passively via my vanguard within a couple of months (assuming the global economy doesn't go absolutely tits up) but fuck man, I burned myself with hot water making myself some pasta yesterday and that really sums up my GME, BB and AMC trading - burnt myself to fuck and I knew I probably shouldn't have done what I did (i held the colander and hot water splashed all over me if you're wondering).\n\nLife lessons: Do your own research, invest in what you truly believe in and has a future in the world (not some stupid meme stocks). Fuck the FOMO and from now on if I do feel FOMO I'll just put some more into my S&amp;S ISA (it gives me the same feeling of satisfaction knowing I'm helping out future me).\n\nI suppose in fairness I did get a real crashcourse in the stock markets - I learned all about the jargon, bubbles and fads (my dad has been telling me about the .com boom etc), how the media spins stories and how the main way that stocks get big isn't through how the company is performing but how its framed to people.\n\nBye-bye £400. I'll never see you again but it's fine - you were the most expensive crash course into investing that I could've had but you're gone now and I've come out the other side a little bit poorer but a lot wiser now. I'm glad I didn't pour my life savings into the stock or do anything more stupid.\n\nI'm still young, I'm only 19 but I'm glad I've got into finance now and not when I'm 25 when I've got more money to spunk away on stupid bubbles. I'm sure this isn't going to be the first big financial loss in my career but I can be thankful that I've got no debt, no credit cards (yet) and I can now just wipe the slate clean and stay the fuck away from day trading for now. WSB may seem fun now but if I stayed with them I know it'll end in tears and heartbreak in the long run. At this point, I don't care if I have to slave away on the corporate ladder for 20 years and consistently build my wealth instead of having the stress of having a large chunk of change disappear with the snap of a finger from Wall Street like Thanos.\n\nMy ending note to my future self:\n\nDear future me.\n\nMake sure you out of the FOMO loops and the bubbles, It's not worth the time, effort and stress in life. Have a beer and jerk off and see how you feel afterwards - if you still feel like you should join because everyone else is - still don't do it. If you still do, then make sure you siphon off your profits as you go - Don't try to get greedy and keep putting up your limits - sell at your price and then GTFO. Don't look back and don't rebuy. Don't go and have a beer because you don't deserve it because you've ignored what I've said like two sentences ago. Even if you still ignore that then make sure you play the safe game, don't put too much money in. Avoid the stupid penny stocks because 99.9% of them go nowhere, avoid the fads and bubbles, be diverse but not too diverse that you make pennies for months at a time - pick something safe with good YoY returns and delete the app for 6 months and return.

My bad I was looking at the google stock ticker as I was too lazy to open my RH app and you are right. It hit $25 before market closed at 4:00 but it did reach $28.77 so it was very close to $30. But again remember, it reached it in a healthy upward momentum during a time where AMC, GME, BB all blew up. Also a time where BBBY also blew up. This ""without any problems"" mentality needs to be taken with an asterisk because the ""without any problems"" part was because they all rose during this time and it was also when the entire market crashed outside of these 4 stocks.\n2. I agree, a lot of people who put in money to BB or heard about BB for the first time thought it was still a phone company. I\'ve seen some posts in this subreddit and /r/stocks that had people saying ""buy BB"" and talking about it as a phone company and I was like these guys really have no idea what they\'re talking about. A month ago, I thought it was still a phone company before I did my research...\n\nI think it is a risk at the current price of $12 because of the exact reasons you just stated. The image is hurt because people think it is a phone company for starters. Then other people think it is a meme stock. And some other people think it is an overvalued company. Everything you listed about it makes a lot of sense and trust me, I had the same mentality and notion. But again, my mindset was going in when it was a $7 stock. \n\nNow it is a $12 stock. You say 6B market cap is nothing for what they sell, but that\'s the bullish mindset. I\'m saying that the bullish mindset is fine but just know that there are a lot of risks with it. A lot more risks at $12 a stock than at $7 a stock. I am keeping it in my watch list and was very high on it when it was $7 a stock, but at the current price it does scare me. We need a lot of things to go right for Blackberry to take off and regain its footing and be a great long term investment (thinking $15-20 a stock range minimum) but we also can have one or two things go against it and completely crash the stock. And at the $12 range, that scares me a lot more than the bullish side.\n\nBB right now seems to survive DUE to its partnerships. Standing alone, it just doesn\'t seem to have enough legs to really take off. And that scares me. It did a great job with the partnership with Amazon and that really drove it up from the $4-5 range to the $7-8 range... but now it is at the $12 range and the Amazon partnership alone won\'t keep it there. The best thing that can happen with BB IMHO is for it to be acquired by a big company but putting a lot of long term investment money in a company in hopes that it gets a great partnership or gets acquired is a big risk. I\'m not saying it is a stock that will fail, but I am saying you need to really assess the risk vs reward of this stock', ""Guy, don't feel bad. I turned 100 dollars into 90k last year.

The boom in 2021 that was driven right alongside GME and AMC didn't even reach $30... it stopped at $25...  \n\n\nThe other question the graph shows is... is BB a normal distribution curve or will it be a parabolic curve.

It is a smart Investment for sure, dont expect anything huge like GME', 'I know your post is 8 hours old, but I hope someone takes the time to read this because I could use a human conversation that provides different perspectives and helps ease my mind. I\'m really sorry for this. I realize this isn\'t a vent subreddit, but I\'d like to share how this post is helping me.\n\nMany months ago, people around me (family) started urging me to get into day trading. I can\'t work a full-time job due to health issues, and job prospects for my education/career path don\'t exist where I live. I have hope for a future but don\'t genuinely believe I have one, so for a long time I\'ve been working on an exit-strategy-for-life. (I\'m fine, don\'t suicide-hotline-number me.) \n\nI was watching from the sidelines for a while, and bought 1 share (very late, at $285). I have 22 at a cost basis of $125.77 (which from what I\'ve gathered is still an okay place to get out or hold long term, but I can also get away with selling during price swings the next couple days). My reason for tossing my money away so comfortably has been, ""I\'m probably going to be dead at X time anyway, so what difference does it make? I lost more in Magic: the Gathering."" \n\nI do think that if I play the long haul on all my shares that it\'d turn out in my favor. I\'m also thinking about what I want in the short term that will make me want to game end less, which is kind of pressing and nearing immediacy. Like having a place of my own where I and my 300 stuffed animals can live, and moving to an area where my SAD (and therefore every other mental health issue) won\'t be so volatile and I\'ll have legitimate job prospects and maybe friends, and affording HRT, and blahblahblah.\n\nSo here is my self-grounding from this post:\n\n* #2: I went in feeling this, and I believe(d) I achieved it. I thought I only put $2450 in but I apparently accidentally did one thing twice so it was $2950. I feel a little less good about that, because I wanted to keep it under $2500. As long as I break even on that (read: sell at at least like 135) I will be okay.\n* #3: Grandma knew about it, but she knew because she was hearing it from me and my other family members before it showed up on TV. She showed me a Tucker Carlson segment the other day. All I could think about was how much I hate his hair. He said a couple good things for a change, though as always it\'s interspersed with absurdity. But I did generally agree with ""financial elite very bad."" \n* #4, 6, 8, 9: I cross-checked information multiple times. Doing research is something I get paid for. I\'m probably good at it in theory when someone else has stake in my work. If I hunkered down and kept learning, I think I could get good at this. I was pretty good at DD for Magic and whatnot, though I was irresponsible and drafted a LOT, which is not smart. I can say wholeheartedly that I learned more in the past week or so about the stock market than I have ever, at all. I went from knowing nothing to knowing the basics, fundamentals, and a few random things I fell into rabbit holes for at like 3am.\n* #7: My gacha game habits both resemble and resent this remark. Thankfully I don\'t usually roll on banners I\'m not interested in, but I do genuinely care about GameStop and would love to see a pivot for the long-term.\n* #10: I don\'t want this to define me, but if it does, it\'ll be because I do like and believe in GameStop &amp; AMC, and I want to find more ways to invest in companies I believe in. (Normally I do this by purchasing from small businesses and encouraging people around me to do the same.) And it\'ll also define me because I have active distaste toward the wealth distribution in the United States, late stage neoliberal capitalism, etc etc don\'t wanna politic. That\'s what I want to remember once I close.', ""That seems like a one-time boost though, what would you say about the longer-term trend of people migrating from actual theatres to online streaming, which has been accelerated by the pandemic? AMC's online game is not doing too well and there is no good reason to think it becomes better."", ""Gotcha. It's funny I thought AMC was the dumbest, silliest investment ever, even as a meme, and no I didn't look into their financials but judging by your and others' comments, their financials are terrible.\n\nBut I put money into GME so I can't really say shit about speculating on shitty businesses"", 'I agree. I got in on the craze. I invested 10k last Wednesday and cashed out up $200 once it started going down that day.\n\nThen I got suckered in again Monday morning and bought 70 shares at $16. It went to $12 and I cut my losses at around $280.\n\nI put most of the money in SPY and VOO today and made $300 so far.\n\nAMC is probably going to keep cratering.', ""Truth be told, AMC will bounce back after some time when Covid is heartily handled. I wouldn't count those as losses just yet."", 'Welcome to the media. You have a lot of money? Then bribe media outlets and then they will paint any narrative of your liking. People with money (hedge funds in the market manipulation case) pay media and brokerage firms and then they paint a narrative (brokers say some bs about ‘protecting’ their users from market volatility as an excuse to prevent buying of certain stocks. And the media saying Reddit is ‘pumping’ some stocks like GME/AMC when in reality they are just using reddit as a scape goat). \n\nI may get heavily down voted for what I’m about to say next but this kind of behavior the media cooperates in is heavily involved with politics. Prime example in the more recent events is the Black Lives Matter movement. Without getting too in-depth into that subject (because I know I will trigger some people) I will just leave it at: that movement was also a very specific narrative painted by the left with many things being untrue. For me, I say this very genuinely: it’s not about politics, but rather facts. I honestly don’t care about politics no where near as I do with facts. People need to learn to do their own research and learn the facts instead of automatically defaulting to disagreeing because of political beliefs or what they heard on the news or on an article. Ask the real questions (just like OP asking a genuine curiosity of why something does not make sense). When you ask and wonder with genuine curiosity on why things are the way they are, you’ll start to find the facts and truth just like reddit did about the collusion between hedge funds and various brokerage firms.', 'If you are really have that much conviction, you will not even be posting this. This sounds to me like self-deception and hoping that others follow suit with your ‘advice’ and prevent the stock from tumbling further. \n\nAnyone with a sound mind In the investing space knows AMC is shit- HUGE debt &amp; increasing competition. Disney, Netflix and Apple TV has been increasing investment to create more content and the pandemic only accelerated that process. Therefore, it is shorted because no amount of innovation can be brought in to revive this business without hurting costs of tickets. The only possible way for AMC to moon is if the government ban all streaming services and clamp down hard on piracy. What are the odds?', ""I feel you. I have been in the market for 5yrs, with a strong investment strategy for the last 3~4yrs after a year of what in hindsight was near gambling. And with all the hype I put a very small amount into GME/BB/AMC as a bit of fun - a gamble if you will. Got early gains and went in heavier buying into the hype, going against all my strategies I had built up thus far. Ended up getting burnt losing 60% of that money and I now have a lot to make up for the year to reach my financial goals. And I gotta say, it hurts. I spent a good day down and out, really upset with myself and lack of judgement, lack of will to resist the mania and hype. But it's not the end, even in the current market conditions there is always chances to invest in solid stocks/businesses that will make you money in the long term.\n\nIts a tough lesson learnt that money doesn't come easy nor quickly - its all about consistantly making smart choices to invest in areas you are confident will make you money."", ""Same. I bought into the hype of gme and amc, but now I'm feeling pretty burned as well.

It seems the a few hedge funders are backed against a wall and their bills are increasing exponentially (aka ""squeeze). And maybe all complete speculation.

As someone who is really down mentally after losing money (not  my lifesavings, I was playing with 3k$) because of making an emotional call, posts like those make me feel a little better. Even though deep inside I am completely hopeless, those little posts without no logical backings make me feel a little better. And that's why they keep getting to the top. Most new WSB members are GME, AMC 'investors' and the subreddit is nothing like I remember since I first saw it. It was filled with crazy people for sure, but they had some rational analysis. Now I see one good post for every 10 to the moon post \n\nThe reason I feel so bad is not because I went with the hype created by people who went all emotional, but because I used my money that I was using to become better at trading to fuel a craze. I went against my own principles.\n\nI started investing in renewable energy last month and had a nice portfolio of PLUG, FCELL, AAPL and I made over 40% over my principle in just 1.5 months.

I am a ride or die with GME, don't criticize me, and holding onto AMC and BB since they have some potential for the future. Whether most of the stuff was real or fake in WSB, some people weren't all in for the money (me being one of them) and some people put what they could afford to lose. I have wasted $200 on dumber stuff before without learning a thing. A lot of people who were only in for the money are very salty about their loss and hopefully learn from their experience. I don't worry about the money as it comes and goes and the whole ride was fun, got me closer to some friends (who too are diamond hands) and some of my family. I think losing my $200 has taught me more about the stock market than I have learned over the fully year and a half and making about 50% of my money by buying stocks of certain companies I believed would climb up. Learned about set limits, buy limits, what happens in the aftermarket, what short selling is, and that people are people.   \nMemes and all, the experience was fun. People shouldn't put as much as they weren't willing to lose and those who put more hopefully sold half during the climb to break even when the fall eventually came. People had different motives for joining, some were in for the money and selling out after some gains, some were in for the long run hoping it would shoot to the stars, some were in to just make some hedge funds lose some money, some were in for the ride of just being apart of something that will definitely make some history in a youtube video, documentary or book, and some were in for the memes and the unity of it seeming like the retail sellers vs the hedge funds.   \nI know a lot of people make fun of us diamond hand holders as it seems after today, but kicking someone when they are down doesn't help much with them getting back up (thanks for the op for picking them up). We are people, we make mistakes. We get back up and fight for another day and next time be more prepared for if any opportunity like this comes again. The most important thing is to be true to yourself, get the basics for yourself before committing to something you aren't ready to lose in. Keep your friends and family close and I hope all you out there, having gains or losses, felt apart of something and were brought closer to that one friend who told you about stocks years ago contacting you again or just your friends and family who were trying to keep up with the whole GME situation. For me it just fueled me more and looking forward to the future. Hold strong boys, win or lose, we are still here.

If you needed to pull money out because you\'re treating it like a bank, you just lost a lot on a dip like that.  Same for if you needed money in March during the dip.  You\'d lose 50% of your value if you needed a car note or something.\n\nThe flip side is, if you need to buy a house in 5 years, you can invest and pull out at the right time.  Value shot up 10%?

I am a relatively new investor (3 years experience) so take my advice with a grain of salt. If you want an easy, low maintenance investment, sell GME and AMC and invest in the money into the S&amp;P 500. ""Trendy"" stocks- such as GME, AMC, and even Tesla, are not safe investments long term. I would have never invested in such stocks to begin with. There is no such thing as \'making a quick buck\' in the stock market unless you really know what you are doing. Stocks, rather than ETFs, bonds, or mutual funds, are extremely high risk.\n\nAs to whether you should sell or hold, I think that is a personal preference in terms of the risk you are willing to take on. I personally think the hype surrounding AMC and GME has reached its peak and is on a downward trajectory. No one can really know this though. If I were in your shoes, I would cut my losses and invest the money into something safer like the S&amp;P, which returns 10% on average every year. Or, sell and invest into an individual stock that you trust/believe in and is not a ""Hype"" stock. As my financial advisor tells me, ""only buy individual stocks of a company whose products you use on a daily basis, whose philosophy and values align with yours"". This strategy has yet to fail me. I invested in Snapchat back when it was $12/share and Lululemon when it was around $100 a share with this in mind. Funnily enough, I also invested in Pfizer then, which surprisingly has stayed relatively consistent even from 3 years ago (I expected more growth). This isn\'t a bad thing though, as I see a company like Pfizer as a relatively safe investment-- their company clearly isn\'t going anywhere. And now, the whole world uses their product on a daily basis in the form of a Covid-19 vaccine. I think companies like this-- big names that aren\'t super volatile- make alright long term investments. Even so, I think the s&amp;p is the way to go.', 'i had a large chunk of my portfolio in at a 13.87 average.

I incidentally made a few hundred on AMC, but I had been holding that one since before the party started and was planning to hold it all year (but didn't). \n\nSo I guess you could say I didn't buy in and hate GME. I'm not some shill or bot account or even jealous. I have a friend who hopped on the GME train and I was rooting for him to make some big money - then maybe he would have had an easier time getting an awesome gaming PC or something. So it's not like I wanted to see him get burned because I didn't like the GME hype.\n\nWhat turned me against it completely was the narrative coming out of WSB that this was some glorious fight against Wall Street, the little guy vs. the hedge funds.

People got big heads about it.\n\nEven if RH and the other brokerages hadn't halted trading, the short squeeze would have eventually ended, and at that time the price would have plummeted. People will take their profits sooner or later; that's the whole point, right? So when these asshole redditors started luring in and encouraging people who had never invested before and never learned a lick about the stock market, trying to get them to buy more more more at ever increasing prices,  I saw it as a huge scam. The people who bought in early were going to make bank, but the new people that bought late and were likely to get caught holding the bag when the price returned to normal would get wiped out.\n\nSo there's a valid reason to dislike what happened with GME and not be jealous or a shill or something. The narrative of some honorable stand against Wall Street was bull - how is it any better to get people on board with the scheme knowing full well a good many of them will lose money?\n\nAlso the big guys on Wall Street probably made a killing too.\n\nAlso also the memes are annoying and frankly they're getting old.\n\nHopefully this helps to reframe your view of why some of us were never on board with GME."", 'The moment they starting promoting amc I knew things were getting stupid', 'When I discovered the sub and almost every single post was about AMC I knew I should keep my hands off that stock', 'Holy shit.

I'm letting a little cash settle and then I'm going to buy MSOS. As a newbie I don't feel like I can research individual companies enough to make an informed decision. However, I live in a state where it's been legal for a while and has a feel for the industry in general. MSOS feels like it's little to no risk with a possible big jump in the middle term.

Democrats arent very likely to put people out of the street and even if they do REIT's would pick up the cheap real estate.

Why? \n\nOriginally, I didn't think the situation was actually that bad, more of a ruse than anything to manipulate people into becoming bagholders while the bad guys win yet again.

I really can't think of a good enough reason. Now take into consideration the trading halts, the naked shorting, etc. Why would a broker not allow high limit sells?\n\nBest answer IMO? They don't want a literal bank run happening. If GME gets squeezed much higher than before, not allowing limit sells means you have to market out. During a real, genuine short squeeze like VW, the peaks from what I have seen are blindingly fast. This means you have to be ready at a split second notice to hit the sell button. If you're late, you could miss hundreds of % or more. With limit orders, you don't need to worry about having to hit the sell button when the squeeze hits.\n\nI still think there is a large amount of manipulation going on that is difficult to differentiate, but almost all signs are pointing to a literal bank run on Wall St. and them doing whatever they can to prevent it. The biggest argument against that, however, is it almost seems like they legitimately WANT it to happen. As if they've basically been setting this up for decades on purpose. Not sure how to explain what I mean here but something just feels 'forced' about this whole situation in a way.\n\nThis COULD be an actual bank run. Wall St. however has trillions of dollars. They also have the best and brightest minds in finance. How in the absolute FUCK could they have messed up this bad and not be able to fix the problem? This whole thing reeks. This all said, I do believe that this story is far from over and may only just be beginning. \n\nLast thing I'll say though, it's really strange to me that BB, AMC, NOK and AMC all basically showed the same price action in their charts.

Buy companies you expect to hold and can look back in the future and not have to constantly worry about the market. The average person SHOULD NOT be looking at their portfolio and getting depression every day. Buy a stock that you would be comfortable holding regardless of dips.

Something different already is that if you look at the charts, GME starting taking off near the last 30 minutes and especially soared during after hours. What I suspect from this is that institutional investors such as Blackrock are going back in to the battlefront. Let's be real here, retail investors simply don't have as much volume as they think. My analogy for those who watch Attack on Titan is think of titans battling one another on GME with the human retail investors at the sidelines doing support and reconnaissance. Of course, we love a good story and there is definitely a David and Goliath narrative being pushed of retail investors taking down the hedge funds and Robinhood to spur momentum. Though having institutional investors on the long position is not a bad thing, in fact I'd argue that the one reason we have not seen Congress or the SEC take decisive action on this is because they know GME is a nuke that is ready to go off and it's better to just look at the aftermath.\n\nWhich leaves a question, why would institutions short again after the shitshow last time, you'd think we taught those old folks a lesson? Well, GME was at $350 during the peak and held support at $90-100 for a while before dipping to $40-50. From a numbers and fundamentals perspective, it actually would be the correct move to short GME at $50-300 because in an ideal world (the efficient-market hypothesis, disclaimer: not an economics student lol), GME does not have the fundamentals to support a price of $50+. However, the funny thing about the stock market is that it's not simply fundamentals; emotions, hype, and feedback loops throw the market into chaos. What this means is that while hedge funds did make the correct move in shorting, particularly as a means to cover their previous positions, this plan could fall apart with enough sentiments.\n\nMy take is that we are seeing institutional and high frequency traders cannibalizing each other and GME became the battlefront of this showdown. However, I do find it funny that a lot of the other stocks like BB, AMC, NOK, etc. that were a part of the hype back in January are also caught in this storm with their tickers showing a similar pattern. I'm guessing there were algorithms and crawlers that managed to catch up while other investors prepare for what is another frenzy in the stock market. Odds are high that we're going to see another red day in the market as the volatility creates more fear and institutional investors cut their losses by selling off their more lucrative long positions. To a lesser extent, there might be FOMO and retail investors, at least a few on WSB are selling off parts of their portfolio to jump on the train again. I do want to know what becomes of this.... what's going to happen with DFV, how will brokers and the SEC react, and what is the conclusion to this Gamestop saga.\n\nEDIT: Didn't know the sub filters low-cap stock in posts as well.

You talked about companies being valued based on future prospects - they did this to avoid bankruptcy. The future prospects of the company at the end of last year when 178 million shares were issued is that the company wouldn\'t survive another year, and now it\'s doing the bare minimum to survive by issuing more debt and equity for a year while generating miniscule revenue because of covid that won\'t cover their expenses. How optimistic is that?

You are correct that the market has grown astronomically since 2017, and AMC\'s also plummeted astronomically since then because it wasn\'t growing at the same rate as the market.   \n\n\n- In what world is AMC currently undervalued?

The subculture found at\xa0https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ seems to\xa0lead many traders in what has become very clearly a call to unity. Flooded with memes, GIFs, and other captioned images in a fisco-political comedy style, the main spotlight is on the nostalgic Gamestop (GME), and as has been heard, already their value has raised from ~$40 to over $400 in a matter of days,\xa0before\xa0shaking up other mass medias. The stock has been extremely volatile,  yet grows stronger at its base, its floor rising slowly yet steadily.\n\n\nSome of the leaders and most experienced members have shared detailed information\xa0about the meaning behind the calls to buy. To me,  it seems there is a trust in strangers that others will call to buy too, reflecting not as much care for the money, gained or lost, but the value of the trust the community reflects within and throughout itself, and among a widely diverse group of free-standing\xa0anonymous\xa0people. For a growing number of people, GME has come to represent that trust, as a flag would represent a nation. \n\n\nMany people lack funds to buy, however, with as many people as there are who would buy into the meaning of community (especially in times of mass isolation), and considering the fact that all of them will have a sudden influx of currency with the stimulus, it seems to be a shared belief that GME will rise and fall and rise again, like a series of rockets, yet with a steady increase of base value. If i am correct, the term ""Diamond hands"" refers to individuals who buy and call to buy ahead, and most importantly hold the stock as tightly as they would a flag for one\'s own freedom. Holding it as though their hands were made of diamond. These intrinsic values are shared in doing so.\n\n\nI know nothing,  but I personally expect to see a series of jumps and crashes in the market starting on the first deposit day, and this after being low the day before. Since the collection of pocket-broker apps and consumer-end trading softwares, such as Robinhood, Cash, and more (best ones are listed on one particular post (link?) are not designed to handle that high level of trade. Furthermore, there seems to be general consensus of stock manipulation by major hedge funds. Very unusual factors of the instability of the stock. \n\nLike a flag in a storm, GME rises. Other\xa0stocks of companies, especially those which offer nostalgia (such as AMC) also are rising for the same cause, but with less coverage.\xa0\n\n\nThe stimulus will surge the market like it\'s supposed to, but with all the new masses of unified citizens presenting themselves as rightful free traders, it will add fuel to their popularly predicted long swell of GME stock value because it is based on a widely held value of community and trust which\xa0has otherwise been stifled for a year or longer, until now.

Personally, I\'m not sure on that one, but if I\'d get it, it would have to be for a long term recovery in light of their reduced but still high debt levels and insecure future.\n\nBB is probably the more solid future story.

Let\'s break down the conclusion section:\n\n&gt; In March 2020, sales by real money investors led to rising volatility in Treasury markets, and corresponding increases in margins and volatility in repo markets. Large sales from hedge funds trading the basis seem to have followed this event. We show some evidence that these sales may have had a smaller effect on dealer balance sheets than might otherwise have been expected, and in fact that dealers attached particular value to these Treasuries during the peak of March stress.\n\nHmm ok, this is interesting, could have a point here. \n\n&gt; However, these facts must be interpreted in the context of a timely and large intervention of the Federal Reserve into Treasury and repo markets. Without that intervention, our model suggests that the amplifying role of hedge fund sales could have exacerbated illiquidity in the Treasury market.\n\nSo... their model is guessing what would have been the case if the Fed didn\'t do exactly what they said they were gonna do, which is to keep highly accommodative policies rolling until the economy is back on its feet. Got it. Things could have been different if they were different.\n\n&gt; In the context of ongoing discussions of Treasury market reform, policy makers should therefore consider both the potential impact of the basis trade on Treasury market liquidity, and the broader context that allowed these trades to be profitable in the first place.\n\nOk, so because ""things could\'ve been different"", lawmakers should maybe pay attention to hedge fund treasury basis trading because it could\'ve caused issues. That\'s fair.\n\n&gt; While this broader research project is only at its beginning, our paper points to important links among repo markets, Treasury markets, and futures markets spanned by hedge funds.\n\nAaaaand there\'s the kicker. ""While we feel we have some good points, this research is preliminary and we can\'t say for sure yet that we\'re right, so we\'re gonna keep looking into this"". That\'s what ACTUAL researchers say after they make statements that they can\'t back up 100%. So they are literally saying that this an unproven THEORY based on a MODEL.\n\n&gt; “Conspiracy theory” that is a .gov website. Read/enlighten/enhance\n\nIt goes from a legitimate theory to a conspiracy theory when someone tries to pass it off as fact. Like with the tinfoil hat post on r/GME, where apparently the author cried several times as they were researching it? Like... what?\n\n&gt; ""Ok but what if they\'re right? You haven\'t actually disproven anything!""\n\nThat\'s where the fed comes in and does something about it... [again](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-reverse-repo-idUSL1N2M625C).\n\nSooo... yeah there are definitely some interesting topics here, not denying that.

If any stock deserved to be shorted it was Gamestop.  The company is unprofitable, it has no real future in the gaming industry (all sales are digital now), and a pandemic has hit that has stopped their brick and mortar operations from operating in most places.  Gamestop\'s ""true value"" is somewhere between $0.50 and $4.00 a share.  It\'s somewhere between a bankruptcy penny stock and ""still surviving but not at my prime.""  It\'s not worth the current $200B value that the share price implies (which would make it a Fortune 500 company).  People choosing to ""punish"" shorters like this is really unusual because the shorters are going to lose a fortune buying at higher prices and holding to keep the price up.\n2. The retail investors are largely an excuse for larger institutions to get involved in the action.  Don\'t believe me?  At $154.69 share price there are 307 institutions owning shares in GME.  [There were 286 at $96.92](https://web.archive.org/web/20210203173906if_/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/holders/).  In that time period Blackrock (one of the biggest investment firms in the world) dumped a million shares making billions of dollars off of retail investors.  But yeah, the man was certainly ""stuck it to"" on that day.  Most of the push to get the price up was done by investment groups and hedge funds that were turning a wicked profit off of all of this.  A lot of retail investors lost their life savings dumping it into Gamestop, all that money went to these giant funds.\n3. Gamestop issued about 70 million shares total.  Currently there are 110 million shares being traded.  The madness has gotten so ridiculous that people are now trading in non-existent shares and holding on to their counterfeit shares.  Trading really should be stopped because there are now more fake shares being traded than real ones.\n4. WSB was frothing at the mouth when Archegos Capital Management went belly up on a margin call.  They all thought it had to do with their activities with Gamestop and AMC had caused this company to fail.  It turned out it had nothing to do with them.  It turned out he was overleveraged betting on Viacom just as they diluted their shares.  It turned out that none of these companies went belly up and had friendly relations with a bunch of groups and financial institutions.', 'Nah, you know what would be cool?

Otherwise imho the opportunity cost is too great - you could be investing that money elsewhere and actually making decent returns.\n\nSo anyways, my mistakes of 2021 so far:\n\n**BB** **(cut) -** I admit it, I got caught up in the reddit hype and bought in at $15+. At the time I was justifying it to myself by getting confirmation bias from all the reddit DDs saying they had a huge number of patents, were going to be leading the way in self-driving software etc. But obviously since then it\'s cratered.\n\nI cashed out at a 40% loss as whilst I don\'t think this stock will drop much further, equally it doesn\'t seem like it\'s going anywhere anytime soon. It\'s a legacy tech company that is making no money, has a lot of patents but patents are worthless if you can\'t monetise them, and mediocre leadership (CEO himself was selling stock as the price peaked). So really I think my cash could be invested better elsewhere.\n\n**COIN (holding)** \\- bought in at $390 hoping it would spike, of course it didn\'t. However I bought in more at $300 and am holding long-term, on the basis that at a $100bn valuation this was probably over-valued, but now it\'s barely worth $50bn which doesn\'t seem crazy compared to companies like SNOW and even PLTR (more on the latter below). Of course it\'s very much dependent on the crypto market so is definitely a speculative investment, but I don\'t think 40-50% gains from here over a few months is unrealistic. I mean their Q1 21 profits were *insane.*\n\n**PLTR (holding) -** bought in at $35, partly because of reddit hype but also because it is a *fantastic* company - Peter Thiel and Alex Karp are veritable genuises, and they really have a huge moat - there is no-one out there who can offer comparable tech currently. Also for all the IT guys on here saying big F500 companies can build their own equivalent software, I would say - have you ever worked for a big corporation? IT always gets the minimum amount possible spent on it (seen as a cost center) and plus data is usually dispersed across numerous legacy databases etc, and nobody has the willingness/skillset to fix it.\n\nHaving said that, I acknowledge this is still speculative because of one thing - *valuation.* I love the company, but even I have to admit they are still expensive at $40bn. If the stock price doubled that would make them an $80bn company, which even for an elite data science/machine learning outfit is a pretty pricey valuation (especially given they\'re not making much in revenue/profits currently).\n\n***AMC (cut)*** \\- again bought into the hype, took a big hit but decided to cut and move on. Ok cinemas are reopening, but AMC now has a similar stock price to pre-covid which isn\'t really justifiable, plus I dont have much faith in the management (CEO paying himself huge bonuses  during the pandemic etc). FYI, for people looking for a better cinema play would check out *Cineworld* (I don\'t currently hold a position but might do shortly) - listed in the UK but they own cinemas all around the world, particularly in the US. Have a lot of debt so speculative, but their price is still well below pre-covid levels at least.\n\n**TSLA (holding) -** think everyone knows Tesla by now, so no analysis needed here. Bought at the Feb peak but the market crashed, holding long-term though as even though the company is expensive at these levels think they have huge future potential.\n\n**NIO (holding) -** same as above.']"

After all why short a stock that is healthy. That would be pure stupidity.\n\nThe ultimate shorting is of course when it bankrupts, so that can be for sure a goal to do that.\nBut let's assume for a moment this is not the goal.\n\nSo squeeze potential, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Company gets shorted, people buy when it's low, eventually shorts gets covered, price goes up for a short bit, and think they did well.\nAnd yes individually they definitely could, but the people shorting probably made a killing already, and average retails hold the bag.\n\nSo what if things are different.\n\nI want to look at AMC here, since I know much more about it then GME.\n\nAMC was doing horrible last year, between debt and covid, they were in a massive mess.\nThey raised capital, theaters are opening and this obviously make the stock worth more. Now how much? Who could say. But it's fair to say that it's worth more than half a year ago from a purely objective standpoint.\n\nThen there is the squeeze. The stock got heavily shorted, reported numbers put it over 20%, fee is over 20%, utilisation at 99/100%, 3+ days to cover etc.\nThe numbers are all there. The stock has went way up, so even if they could cover all of it at the current price, they (hedgies like citadel) would be losing so much money, in fact they already lost massive amounts. Simply put, they are in big trouble.\n\nNow what does the community claim, 1k, 10k and even 100k per share. I always say I do not know where it goes, but 100k is flatout BS. Though in fairness, if you can make people believe it, it's easier to get the price up when they start to cover.\n\nSo why is this different? Outside of the numbers, the most important part is that AMC is worth more than where they shorted, they cannot bring the price back to that point, and retails won't let them, it doesn't matter what the market usually does, if people do not sell, they have a massive problem.\n\nThe AMC short squeeze is real, it's that simple.\n\nNow will everyone make money?

That's a pretty massive claim, so you need to substantiate it. AMC has 25% institutional ownership which is enough for shareholders to push for the company to offer more shares, plus the dilution vote was only for the 500 million shares they wanted to offer (correct me if I'm wrong on this) and they're not under any obligation to not offer more shares. Plus, why wouldn't AMC want to capitalize on this? It would get them out of the dire debt situation they're in, and the fact that they were intending to offer 500 million shares shows that they have the motivation to do so, should demand be so high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We own the float and we are not selling, and there is a crazy amount of naked shorts to cover: this is not about fundamentals, this is about the illegal naked short selling done for over a year.\n\nOk, so they are many problems with this. First of all, there isn't any concrete proof that AMC is completely owned by the float, unless every AMC holder in retail tallies their shares. Second, even if you aren't selling, traders can still short the stock, by borrowing shares, I'm not sure how this is relevant.  Third, I'm pretty confident that naked shorting is illegal, and if AMC was so heavily shorted in the fashion you're talking about, then the data should prove so, but it's not. The current % of the float short is at around 20% which is high, but nowhere near high enough to create such a massive return. These are the statistics that we can find on any AMC quote, and I don't understand how these things could be so massively faked across literally every single financial site, with no whistleblower coming to call them out on it, not to mention it would probably cost them more money to cover it up than to have it entirely open, and AMC hasn't even had a catalyst for a squeeze yet."", 'I swing trade amc on the dips and highs.... had a nice day today', ""I started getting involved in the market a year ago, and I remember the entire time during corona, I would be learning non-stop about every little detail about the market.

I think they're jerks obviously, but I'm more focused on making my own money. I think around when GME hit $400ish, EVERYTHING in my portfolio went down, since people were dumping their stocks for meme stocks.

Let me try and answer some of your questions - \n1. AMC - hey, a lot of people got in on investing with GME and AMC, so don’t sweat it. However know that those are very rare events and are not likely to happen again. Your learning should be that don’t invest in hype / meme stocks. Start with ETFs (VTI, QQQ etc.). Invest in companies that you believe in. This has been repeated multiple times - Time in the Market beats Timing the Market. What that means is that play the long game, hold stocks long term and react based on how those companies are performing. \n\n2. Taxes / Short term vs. Long term gains - Any profit you realize will be taxed. So if you buy a stock and sell for profit - the profit is taxed. How much it is taxed depends on how long you have held your position. If you hold for longer than a year, you fall into long term capital gains tax, which is lower than short term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income. The profit will be taxable irrespective. Even if you invest it somewhere else, you are taxed on the profit you made from the sale.\n\n3. 401K and Roth IRA are tax advantaged retirement schemes. You can’t transfer stocks from your brokerage to your retirement fund. However, you can use your 401K/IRA funds to invest in different portfolios. I would suggest not to gamble with your retirement money. Choose a risk profile depending on your age / appetite and let that money compound and grow. Use extra money to invest in individual stocks. \n\n4. You will have a different account for each service - A Vanguard Brokerage account, a Roth IRA account, 401K etc. They are different from each other and not part of the same pool of money. \n\n5. I am not sure about funding a Roth IRA using 401K. They are quite different. For your 401K, you are deducted pre tax, but are taxed when you get the money back at retirement. For Roth IRA - you contribute post tax money, however, when you withdraw at retirement, you don’t pay any tax. \n\nThere are lots of articles out there that go into the basics of your question.

Then, I “rode the wave” as the price rose and sold my shares after a few minutes in, acquiring decent and acceptable (to me) gains.

Then a few smart folks out there noticed and spread the numbers all across media outlets. This led to a glorious community of supporters of the company that dug deeper into the technicals of what was going on and found out that some hedge funds were pumping synthetic shares (naked shorts; borrowment of a shares that get sold multiple times) into market place trying to drive the price down even further. The community rallied, bought shares and options contracts for the last 5 months and have so far made it possible for AMC to keep afloat through 2022. Their largest shareholder slowly eased out of their holdings and the community bought them all up.\n\nTo this day, the shorts have not covered their shorts (or naked shorts). In fact, they continue to short the stock. Since the stock holders own around 80% of the available common stock and likely most if not all of the synthetics, the owners are waiting for the hedge funds to cover their shorts and to buy back the synthetic shares. Multiple. Times. \n\nAMC is also going to do a share recall at the beginning of June to see who owns what and how many shares are actually in circulation. There should only be 493 Million. Those hedge funds who have not covered their positions are heavily leveraged and under water. It is anticipated that their financiers are going to demand they have the money in cash to balance their books. This is called a margin call. The community is in the strong belief that they cannot do this. If they cannot, their positions will be forced to liquidate, thus bankrupting the hedge fund.\n\nHedge funds have been doing shenanigans like this since the 1920's, resulting in one of the worse economic unravelings in the world. The internal governing body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been writing and passing new laws and votes to curtail this behavior after the GameStop price skyrocketed. \n\nWhat is going on right now with AMC is a combination of big money manipulating the market and the retail investor going head to head.

For almost two months now both AMC and GME have been steadily climbing. It looks like it’s starting to “squeeze” as some would say but they have been both pretty consisted with the market.

I actively manage about 60% of it as I am looking for aggressive growth over the next 10 Ish years. The other 35-40% is put into SPY and VTI, plus some dividend-growth ETF’s.

I closed the position for a (after commissions/fees) $5,800 profit later that day.\n\nUltimately, I risked assignment and a loss of only my profit on the previous trade (and a *huge* on-paper loss which is great for tax purposes), and got my gambler’s urge out on a short-term, highly leveraged position that showed big ol huge green numbers to tickle my dopamine.\n\nI do this pretty regularly and have an 85% YTD success rate.

When you don’t return it and there are shares just floating around that are synthetic. GME went to 140% shorted which is the legally allowed limit in the US. In Europe you are allowed to rehypothicate shares to a unlimited amount. Infinite. When Lehman Brothers crashed in 2008 they couldn’t even find the shares. I would think there is a lot of synthetic shares floating around for AMC and GME. Now something has to happen as a catalyst to get those shares recalled. Such as a proxy vote, merger, Etc.

Just trying to get out of this mess. Again, overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I\'m not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k before exiting.  If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...\n\nI was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold!  I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar.  I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. Then there were 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down  and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).\n\nThis third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn\'t worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week on the spike up to $36 ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I\'m never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so then it made me think I was going no be missing out on all the continued prices drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing current losses in a few steps for nothing.\n\nSo now I\'ve lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and a couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now.  My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we\'re in a reversal downtrend then close out. \n\nMy reason for not simply closing it is because I\'d lose my short position and I do believe it\'s going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I\'d say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees its a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I\'m down by just closing out now. \n\nNo I don\'t have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn\'t seem like I would qualify. \n\nIDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there\'s still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don\'t mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses. \n\nI do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn\'t my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I\'m fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been taking about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary and I\'ve already done tons of planning... just haven\'t finalize bc of COIVD concerns. She\'s single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn\'t paid child support in the last year and serves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I\'m sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn\'t if I don\'t get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option. \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn\'t be messing with shorting.', ""Nah.

Those post offering shorts are now certainly getting margin called, but how high can they take the price while covering? There’s plenty of float for them to cover with, and while it is probably causing a gamma squeeze it’s still only going to have so much of an effect, the rest has to come from investors buying up bags at or near the top.

Here's how I would play it:\n\n* Growth combined with stability.  You don't want to lose your principle, but you want to grow with the market.  Nothing hurts you long term in this category like a market / stock decline.\n* Once you get to a position you're comfortable, shift slowly.  You may have bought a high flyer like TSLA or AMC, but you don't want to lose the gains you've made.  Go to SPY or VTI for the solid returns without incurring the risk of a SEC violation taking out your CEO or Chairman for too many tweets.  \n* Index funds pay maybe 2% in dividends.  You don't want to focus purely on that as a 2% dividends combined with 2% in growth means you can sell that 2% and still see a 4% rate of return (2 + 2 = 4) which is how we can be safe with a 6% rate of return\n* The variation on the above bullet is to then go after a CEF which pays a flat dividend (based upon stuff like NAV) which can yield that 9-10% as well.  Point is that you can have someone else manage your dividends and just pick the premium along with the investment portfolio to give you the rate of return you want.  \n* Options chains exist for an income stream, presuming you don't want to go with naked calls.  But a wild swinging market can upset the equilibrium of a steady income stream.\n* Get a job.  $12.5/hr working full time gives you $25K a year pre-taxes (2000 x $12.50).  Of course higher paying multiples will help you here so that you can get by with 10 hrs of work at more pay.  This includes buying into a business or into a seasonal job.  \n\nRule of thumb for me.  4% rate of return meaning $500K.  It'll cover inflation."", 'Not trolling but why is everyone saying AMC to $1k?', 'Literally is hysteria, that’s what I told my father today when I watched the AMC stock soar up on pure speculation.

This is what Hedgefunds do; they profit from bankrupting companies. Not only did they short these stocks, they used *leverage* to short them, essentially going all in on this bet. \n\nBut many people caught onto this, that these hedgefunds had exposed themselves completely, and that if these companies didn't go under, they would be absolutely fucked. And so an organic community formed behind this idea; to save these companies and fuck over hedgefunds.

While I was obviously not party to the AMC discussions re the bail out as I call it, by the 560% increase in the share price, the short sellers were short a ton more than they could buy. You’re clever, so you know that the price increase was exponential, were it not for an 11m dump the price would likely have been way over double that.  The timing, what a coincidence that AMC were just about to dump another 11m shares when the squeeze happened, and I no longer believe in Father Christmas. So yes, I think the shorts were bailed out by AMC, regardless of the degree to which it was orchestrated.\n\nI take just a teeny bit of a exception to your saying I don’t care about the facts. I do care, and I’m totally willing to learn, but I also have a free brain to question the ways people justify evil. So I understand the distinction between so called naked shorting and shorting borrowed shares, I just choose not to believe the BS narrative created by the manufactured nomenclature.  If I steal your bicycle and sell it to Peter, it’s theft. If I tell the judge that Paul loaned it to me, even though it’s your bicycle, it’s still theft. Even if Peter bought it from me, paid me and sold it to John, Peter still sold what was not rightfully his, it’s still stolen property. So I see the distinction, I just call the distinction the BS it is.  In fact, I think you prove my point, in your example, there was only one block of a hundred shares. If there are 200 shares short, only 100 could ever not be naked because there’s still only one 100 block of real shares, the other 100 has to be “naked”.  The 100 shares belong to person A, only him selling them can change that.  The other two 100 blocks are what is phantom, therefor the shorts are naked.', ""For example, AMC reached 100% short share utilization since March. That's a sign that there shouldn't be anymore shares to borrow yet we still see them able to borrow hundreds of thousands of shares each day. That should be suspicious enough for an investigation hence why BTIG received a lawsuit by the SEC 3 weeks ago. The same guy who said AMC was worth a penny also works for BTIG. What a surprise.."", 'How do you explain brokerages reporting more than 100% SI? If I’m to believe my broker, not all float shares are available to be loaned, including mine. Sure there are many others, including institutional holdings that are not available, so how come the high percentages?  Also, you want to tell me that they’re so concerned with not shorting more than they have borrowed, they have controls in place? Since when is someone’s belongings available to be loaned by another part to a third party so that they can racketeer to make a profit, which does not even go to the legitimate owner of the belongings. More than conspiracy, fact!  And why is it necessary for short sellers to pay exorbitant prices to cover if so many shares are available to borrow or purchase? Why is it necessary for AMC to bail out the shorts at more than 5 times the price they issued shares at just the other day?  All shorting is naked shorting, pretending otherwise because you perhaps have ostensibly borrowed it from someone else, who borrowed it from someone else, without the latters knowledge, just adds theft to the charge of naked short selling.', 'Thank you! I know it’s extremely volatile and anything could happen. I think I’ll re invest my profits into some index funds and keep the other half in AMC a little longer.

Sell immediately or don't play the game. Never get sucked into the hype or fomo. That's how you buy high and sell low in absolute despair..\n\n2) put in stop losses. Dont go down to 10% and your cut losses if the stock drops too much. I think it gets harder to make up for the loss as the stock drops further and further, so don't believe in the idea that it will rebound. Because that's never a given.\n\n3) Don't be greedy and take your wins as and when you can. Likewise, if you still believe that the fundamentals are in order, keep your money in the stock. But again, refer to point no.2 which is to put in stop losses so you don't go into red territory.  You can always buy back in when prices drop. \n\n4) look for bargains and try to buy into a stock at a good price. Study historical price and trends over the past few months and quarters. Look for reasons why the stock is due for rebounds. Maybe it's better quarterly targets, more streamlined business, &amp; etc.\n\n5) Try to make more long term plays.

I am no shill. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/e2kXPZ8](https://imgur.com/a/e2kXPZ8)\n\nLet’s begin, over the past few weeks the FED has been going crazy with reverse repo operations. Today they past their cap of 500 billion dollars and settled a reverse repo operation of 502.904 billion dollars. Here is the history of reverse repos. \n\n[https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000)\n\nWhat is a reverse repo? Well from Investopedia ""A [reverse repurchase agreement (RRP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp) is an act of buying securities with the intention of returning, or reselling, those same assets back in the future at a profit. This process is the opposite side of the coin to the repurchase agreement. To the party selling the security with the agreement to buy it back, it is a repurchase agreement. To the party buying the security and agreeing to sell it back, it is a reverse repurchase agreement. The reverse repo is the final step in the repurchase agreement, closing the contract.""\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-repurchase-agreement-and-reverse-repurchase-agreement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-repurchase-agreement-and-reverse-repurchase-agreement.asp)\n\nWhy has the FED been going so crazy with these reverse repo agreements? Simple, there is way too much money in the American economy. Since the pandemic started, the FEDs money printer has been going BRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Here is a screen shot of the current inflation adjusted charts of the S&amp;P 500, Dow and NASDAQ:\n\n[https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/04/the-s-p-500-dow-and-nasdaq-since-their-2000-highs](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/04/the-s-p-500-dow-and-nasdaq-since-their-2000-highs)\n\nWhy is this an issue? Well, because the fed has been printing money and giving it to the American people through stimulus checks and the amount of spending has gone down through the pandemic, the American people have more money parked in the big banks than ever before. The big banks are currently losing money on interest payments because of all this money. This is where the repo market comes into play. The banks don\'t want all this money, so they perform repo contracts with the FED. The banks are buying securities in the form of treasury bonds from the fed in order to get rid the money. The Fed then has to buy these securities back at a later date, and higher price. This is the essence of the repo market. The banks and the fed are using the repo market as a way to keep interest rates within their targets and control the amount of liquidity they both have. The FED wants to keep printing money to keep the economy running and the banks want to get rid of the printed money to keep the lights on. Now, how does this tie in with AMC and GME?

Since apes like you and I have been buying and holding AMC, GME the price has gone up due to gamma squeezes, momentum and some legal shorts covering.

This is why it has been going on for so long. They lose money from these terrible short bets, but allow the price to rise and gain some cash from options contracts and other derivatives.

But they have been shorting the fuck out of these bonds and a lot of different stocks throughout the pandemic. So how does it all end? The feedback loop will eventually be broken due to the increasing interest payments of losing short positions. When this happens, the banks won\'t be able to keep performing these repos, the FED won\'t be able to perform reverse repos, interest rates will either sky rocket or go negative I’m not sure which but I can tell you either one of those options will crash the economy. The FED and the banks have two options right now, hyperinflation and great depression. They can\'t keep this dance going for much longer since it is pretty much confirmed today that there is indeed ILLEGAL shorting happening to AMC and probably GME too. \n\n[https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Shareholder-Count/default.aspx#:\\~:text=Commenting%20about%20the%20share%20count,holding%20of%20around%20120%20shares](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Shareholder-Count/default.aspx#:~:text=Commenting%20about%20the%20share%20count,holding%20of%20around%20120%20shares).\n\n""Commenting about the share count, AMC President and CEO Adam Aron said, “The number of investors who want to own a part of AMC continues to increase and now stands at approximately 4.1 million.

Reverse Repo market and Synthetic Shares.\n\n Hello, my fellow apes\n\nI am a 20 year old Canadian university student that invested in the original AMC ""squeeze"". I had little investing experience and knowledge, but over the past 6 months I have read so much to do with AMC and GME stock that I think this is going to be the next financial crisis. Here’s a screenshot of my positions, as well you can check my post history. I am no shill. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/e2kXPZ8](https://imgur.com/a/e2kXPZ8)\n\nLet’s begin, over the past few weeks the FED has been going crazy with reverse repo operations. Today they past their cap of 500 billion dollars and settled a reverse repo operation of 502.904 billion dollars. Here is the history of reverse repos. \n\n[https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000)\n\nWhat is a reverse repo? Well from Investopedia ""A [reverse repurchase agreement (RRP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp) is an act of buying securities with the intention of returning, or reselling, those same assets back in the future at a profit. This process is the opposite side of the coin to the repurchase agreement. To the party selling the security with the agreement to buy it back, it is a repurchase agreement. To the party buying the security and agreeing to sell it back, it is a reverse repurchase agreement. The reverse repo is the final step in the repurchase agreement, closing the contract.""\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-repurchase-agreement-and-reverse-repurchase-agreement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-repurchase-agreement-and-reverse-repurchase-agreement.asp)\n\nWhy has the FED been going so crazy with these reverse repo agreements? Simple, there is way too much money in the American economy. Since the pandemic started, the FEDs money printer has been going BRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Here is a screen shot of the current inflation adjusted charts of the S&amp;P 500, Dow and NASDAQ:\n\n[https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/04/the-s-p-500-dow-and-nasdaq-since-their-2000-highs](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/04/the-s-p-500-dow-and-nasdaq-since-their-2000-highs)\n\nWhy is this an issue? Well, because the fed has been printing money and giving it to the American people through stimulus checks and the amount of spending has gone down through the pandemic, the American people have more money parked in the big banks than ever before. The big banks are currently losing money on interest payments because of all this money. This is where the repo market comes into play.

While other companies have been sleeping and sticking to old models, Netflix steadily grew its own content farm and became a big player in custom content, paying new and buzzing creators big payouts and building a reputation of creative freedom and quality similar to what HBO and AMC networks were able to build. In addition, Netflix has really found out the international game, creating quality custom content for other countries. The custom new content will only grow, with hits such as Stranger Things, Queen's Gambit, Tiger King, and Bridgerton. \n\nNetflix also has superior data tracking, allowing them to find out exactly what you like and gear content creation where the audience is better than any competition other than maybe Disney. Disney is limited by its brand however, and can't stray too far from the Disney principles, similar to how Nintendo can't stray too far from their style of content.   \n\n\nNetflix is still the leader with over 200 million subscribers, Disney with over 100 million and HBO and Huly with only about 40 million. Other services straggle with far less than 40 million subscribers. Killer content like The Office isn't enough to combat this. By being an early player, with superior tech, Netflix is poised to be a market leader for years to come. In addition, other companies will find the costs of getting into the battle too high and they may fold. In order to compete with the established players, they have to offer a competing price point, which means they have a higher price for content per subscriber.   \n\n\nI believe Netflix will continue to be able to produce content that can capture audiences, while the other companies to compete will have deep pockets like Amazon, Disney and Apple, and we may see some companies give up and realize licensing their content is the way to go to be profitable, instead of having to get into the business of technology which is an expensive business to run. Also, it's been shown that users have a higher threshold of acceptance for being subscribed to multiple services. Most people will probably have a combination of Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney and find this totally acceptable. I feel that shorting Netflix would be a foolish thing to do, as they are still in a long term trend of adding subscribers and while the trend is slowing, they show no signs of declining, even with competition.  \n\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/250934/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-worldwide/#:\\~:text=Netflix%20had%20207.64%20million%20paid,Netflix's%20total%20global%20subscriber%20base."", 'I have only been investing for a year and am very green.

Until we have enough solar just to cover that, it makes no sense to build anything else. Once this practical limit has been reached, then its time to look at options but this wont happen for a while. Possible not in a decade.\n\nAnd to make matters worse for nuclear, the price of solar and batteries is still in free fall. Battery prices have declined more than 50% in the last 5 alone, with no end in site. Odds are, we will see another 50% haircut, if not more, in 10 years just from scale alone.

In fact, it can probably be made at home and stored in tanks for a pretty low cost.\n\nSo in other words, the only thing that makes sense moving forward is renewables and maybe/probably hydrogen as a backup. In 20 years, most homes will simply have solar + batteries. Hydrogen will be cheap so folks will buy hydrogen burning generators as a backup.
