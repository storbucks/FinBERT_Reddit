2021-05-05,"[""Wow, thank you very much for your time. These are the last questions I'll ask and hope you feel better soon. It's okay if you're not really their target market  IMO - this info is, like, profoundly juicy to me. But here goes:\n\n1. From what I can tell, the risk-sharing models do seem to be in good faith and have a reliable chance of reducing the cost of care and at least *maintaining* quality of care. Other than the reliability of FFS, why is there resistance to these changes? (For large and/or smaller primary cares)\n2. In your opinion, why have healthcare startups failed in the past and why are there so many cropping up now? I am personally a simp for Chamath and I did some previous DD debunking misleading info on the CEO. This has caused me to kind of fall into favor with CLOV, but I'd like to know what you think about the general health insurance marketplace.\n3. Related to that - Why has BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. been so difficult to meet competitively? Has it just been economy of scale issues and that's it? To what extent do these companies legitimately meet their reputation of being corrupt in various systematic ways? Or do you disagree with that at all?\n\nAnd that's where I'll try to curb my curiosity haha. Really appreciate your responses and I've gotten more from this than I could've hoped in the first place! Thanks again!"", 'No worries. I\'m actually home sick right now (not Covid, just sinus infection) so I don\'t have much else to do, anyway. :)\n\n1. They sent our practice a cold call email with the features and it seemed cool looking, so I tried it out. I tend to try lots of demos mostly just to see what is out there, but I never really have plans to make a full switch because we like ECW. It was more curiosity than a desire to switch, really. If it had been a platform that could have integrated directly into our EMR, that would have been better. \n2. We pay a quarterly licensing free for ECW and had/have some setup costs with new features. Overall, the expense is roughly $15k + $5k per provider, per year. I think the biggest hurdle is that it isn\'t using practice data, but insurance claim data. In theory, that should be the same, but it is definitely not in practice. We are also rather unique in that we don\'t participate with Medicare, so we have very few MA patients and wouldn\'t be able to use this for 95% of our patients. That point was probably my biggest reason for not adding one extra tool, even though it is free. At some point, there is just too much data and you can\'t expect employees to navigate it efficiently, so we stick with basic measures and just try to do really well on them. \n3. Nobody else has offered to pay us to use a service, so that is unique. Athena has a free EMR version, but it is ad-supported so our visit notes would look like they\'re sponsored by a drug company, which isn\'t a good look! The financial incentive selling points seem to be the ability to easily qualify for Medicare Meaningful Use, but we don\'t participate so that benefit doesn\'t help us. \n4. I have had more pitches for a direct contracting service in the last two months than I\'ve had in 14 years, so I feel like a ton of companies are trying to jump on what they are as easy money. We are a part of an ACO, but are not subject to capitation. I think FFS is going away, but not until something like Medicare for All is passed. Not sure of the timeline there, but I\'d expect 2023 to be the point where smaller primary cares actually start moving towards something like that. Our ACO has put December 2022 as their ""you must promise to at least consider a capitation model"" deadline, but we are not required to switch at that point. \n\nLastly, because we don\'t take Medicare, I don\'t think we are exactly Clover\'s target market right now and may not be the best perspective on their sales pitch. All the commercial insurances are already doing their own similar thing, so they\'ll be competing with existing products from BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. if they ever mean to expand past Medicare.', 'That helps a ton thank you! I appreciate you taking the time I also have a few more! I’ll try to keep this list shorter, though.\n\nWhat were you looking for when you tried the clover assistant? Or, what would have made you think it was a ‘truly innovative tech’?\n\nI believe another portion of Clover’s incentive (beside doctor pay) was that while most EMR software has a monthly fee - the clover assistant is free because it is vertically integrated into a Medicare advantage insurer. Do you have any vision on that? Do you pay monthly for eclinical works? (You mentioned telehealth but I wasn’t sure about pricing overall)\n\nAlso, how often does anyone else pay you to use their software? Or what are other incentives?\n\nPossibly separate and unrelated - how do you feel about the direction the CMS is taking with direct contracting? Are you an ACO or do your physicians participate in capitation? What is the state of FFS of the industry, in your opinion?\n\n\nThat was longer than I intended, lol. And I’m sure you’re working atm - but when you have time please let me know!', 'That helps a ton thank you! I appreciate you taking the time I also have a few more!

WELL  won months ago.', 'Sorry for the delay! I hope this helps!\n\n1. Our EMR, and all others I\'ve tried, has actionable notices/alerts on each patient that we can configure with our own settings. eg. Mrs. A\'s last mammogram was 5 years ago, they are due now. We also have query tools where we can find every patient that is currently due for a particular measure, as well, so we can address is individually or as a part of population management. Clover\'s appeal seemed to be ""full automation,"" but we are a part of several different reporting and quality programs that all have slightly different recommendations, so they ""human entry"" portion of the measure alerts is actually quite important to us. \n2. Depends on the type of update, really. We use eClinicalWorks and the software goes through complete version updates every year or two, minor bug updates every 2-3 months, and Rx/Coding/Measure database updates every month or so. I didn\'t get much info on the updates, but I\'m guessing the 2-3 week thing is really only for the databases, but I don\'t know. Would seem unnecessary and difficult to train on if they made fundamental changes to the software that often. \n3. Our EMR has integrated TeleHealth visits for about two years now. Schedule appointments and patients just sign into their portal account on their phone or computer and we can video chat directly inside the EMR. Pretty cool, but they charge $2 every time we use it. Free for all other visits and no up front costs, so it isn\'t too big of an expense. \n4. I\'d have to see the incentives! I tend to prioritize simple workflow for our staff and efficiency for our patients, so it\'d have to be seamless to consider it, regardless of how much they pay us to use it. \n\nI hope that helps!', 'One of the few health companies you can say this about. Cough cough CLOV...', 'Definitely appreciate you saying that. \n\nThis is certainly the gist I get about their software, especially how it relates to Electronic Medical Records; pretty standard fare.  What makes me interested is the suite-like modular and iterative component as well as the people working on it - specifically Andrew Toy. I actually would have a bunch of questions for you if you don’t mind - (maybe DM me?)\n\nWhat extent does your other EMR software pertain to actionable patient recommendations? Or rather, what are the comparable features you are referring to?\n\nHow often does your other EMR software get ‘updated’? Clover has talked about the intention to update their software every ‘2-3 weeks’. Have you witnessed one of these updates with the Clover Assistant? What kinds of changes took place?\n\nClover has talked about tele-health features being implemented in an update. Do you have any vision on this?\n\nA big part, in my mind, of the software taking market share in the early stages, is Clover incentivizing doctors (especially PCP’s) by paying them more for using the software. Do you have any vision in this? (Although, I guess you did say it was a demo...)\n\nI can leave it at that for now. I know I’m probably asking a lot from you 😅but it would definitely help me out!']"

2021-05-11,"[""Sure. I consider a lot of things. My question isn't IF CLOV is a good investment, my question is WHY there are reddit profiles that appear to be entirely dedicated to promoting it. And who benefits from the promotion. My first concession is that it might be a good opportunity."", 'I havent seen it. Maybe for people who buy processed stuff like canned or frozen? Dunno. I buy very little of those except maybe tomato sauce/paste and I havent noticed a change there. \n\nI regularly buy squash, cauliflower, and beans for stews (with beef obviously). Broccoli, spinach, lettuce &amp; tomatoes for salads. None of those have changed. Onions are up as I mentioned above. Oh potatoes are up slightly too but also not enough to really matter to me. Other stuff I buy so little of that I cant tell, like ginger... I guess garlic is up a little. Its like 2 big cloves for a dollar now but again, those used to fluctuate in the past so I cant really tell if this is permanent.\n\nAgri fluctuate so much even during normal years that its hard to say for sure if its inflation. Between seasonal changes and other factors its really hard to keep track of it. For example, when CA had a drought we had a few items go up (nuts and berries) but a lot didnt change especially if it came from Mexico (like avocados).\n\nRegardless, my big worry is housing, not food. Rent is going up fast. That pushes investors to real estate and we already had a shortage prior. With bonds in the gutter that pushes even more competition for housing. I dont think that is healthy. We need to somehow push investors out of single family homes and condos/townhomes. I dont mind them playing around with big apartment complexes or commercial but I think we need to de-incentivize them to buy normal single occupant homes. Disclaimer: I am guilty of this myself but what choice is there right now?', 'Sorry for the delay! Feeling better means back to work, missing work means LOTS of work, so I haven\'t Reddited much lately. Thanks for the kind words and I hope these answers are just as helpful!  \n\n\n1. I\'ve been managing a healthcare practice for about 15 years and there are a ton of people who just don\'t want to change, really. Most of these risk sharing models are developed either by hospital systems or insurers, both of which I\'ve learned not to trust completely in any scenario. That ""good faith"" is hard to accept when they\'ve been actively trying to screw over and bankrupt independent providers in almost every way since I started. My guess is that any other administrators with enough experience to have any type of ""power"" in their organization have dealt with similar things and simply don\'t trust that good faith. \n2. I think healthcare startups fail because they only see money. We have been in business for 30+ years because we care about people first and assume the money will show up later. I have definitely gone several months without paying myself during tough times, but our employees always get paid and our customers never feel like they\'re being overcharged. Every sales pitch I receive that mentions how much we can earn before they mention how much we can help our patients is basically dead on arrival. One quick example - there is this one sales rep that I absolutely hate (yes, Keith, I\'m talking about you). He is a complete jerk, talks down to our front desk, and thinks the most basic things that I\'ve seen for years are always brand new / revolutionary ideas. He comes back about once a year, each time working for a new startup, and pitching the same ""look how much money you\'re leaving on the table!"" kind of pitch. I\'m sure he keeps getting jobs because of his ""connections"" in the area, but they just don\'t realize that his connections hate him. The types of companies that continue to hire that guy have no idea what it takes to last in a business that relies on satisfied customers. \n3. Scale is super important and I believe the biggest advantage for these companies is employer-based insurance plans. They can pitch one HR rep and get 10,000 patients immediately. Then, because of their scale, they can always slightly undercut any competitor and keep their employer contract. New insurers also don\'t pay nearly as much as companies like BCBS/Cigna/UHC, too. Little/new players can often compete on efficiency and customer service, but I\'d rather use my experience to navigate a slightly harder process than take 25% less for the same service. There is a lot of resistance to changing systems/plans/processes in healthcare, in general, because everything takes a lot of time. To change to a new EMR, for example, I\'m going to need a company that is willing to give us some type of hazard pay / bonus to even consider a switch, just because it would require such a drastic change to our daily business. It would, literally, take an entire year to transition our staff and 5000 patients to a new system, with all sorts of daily hassles along the way and allowances to see fewer patients per day because we just aren\'t as good with the software as we used to be. Just pitching me a couple hundred bucks per month in savings isn\'t even close to paying for that hassle. Change is super expensive in healthcare, basically. Every insurance seems corrupt, but really they just set ultra strict policies that they follow exactly, even in common sense situations where you\'d think, ""they wouldn\'t deny that, would they?"" Hell yeah they would! The ""corruption"" angle is because a normal person assumes they are going to help them, but they never do anything that they didn\'t tell you about from the start. You just don\'t assume they could be so evil as to \\*actually\\* enforce their rules when you\'re in pain, but they do. \n\nI feel like I might\'ve gotten off on an anti-insurance tangent there at the end (old wounds still haven\'t healed, lol). I\'m rooting for stuff like CLOV to be successful, I just don\'t see them as anything special, unfortunately.']"

CLOV rose to 28 dollars premarket and dipped past maker closing by 15% in an hour while being owned by little to no retail investors in comparison???', 'For those asking about market surge: \n \nI have made a lot of money in just a few months by playing the list of stocks Robinhood restricted back in January, as well as WSB pump and dumps. Some of these stocks have high short interest, but many of them are simply pump and dumps being shilled by bullshit WSB accounts. \n \nThe key is pretty simple: spend a LOT of time on Reddit, and get out before the pump dumps. \n \nHere’s how you do it: \n \nSo basically, recently WSB has been invaded by shills. The sub has totally changed, and it’s now a pump and dump cesspool. \n \nBut you can make good money from it. The key is to constantly browse by new in the EARLY morning EST hours (I’m a night owl on the west coast so I just look around 1AM PST), as well as browsing posts from weeks or months earlier. You should know every single stock being talked about on WSB like the back of your hand. \n \nI’ll use CLOV as an example. Back in March, CLOV was the hot ticket pump stock. It got pumped up to $30 and then dumped, and it bottomed out at around $9, where it stayed for several months. Lots of people were left holding the bag. \n \nBut after browsing new on WSB one late night/early morning, I noticed that a bunch of **really sketchy accounts** (less than 1k karma, never invested before but suddenly posting huge YOLOs with the “WSB lingo”) were trying to push CLOV again. \n \nThere’s a very specific way they do it: first, very rational, very calm posts appear that talk about why CLOV still has massive potential. (This happened around the end of may). \n \nThen, over the next few days or weeks as the stock rises, the posts get more and more manic — until they’re all in all caps, with huge (photoshopped) “YOLO plays,” DEMANDING that you BUY NOW because it’s GOING TO THE MOON. \n \nWhen that happens, the stock’s about to get dumped. \n \nBut as soon as I saw CLOV posts start to resurface in new, I got in at market open at $9. And just like clockwork, the stock rose like crazy over the course of the next week. \n \nWhen the manic “all in” posts started being spammed on WSB nonstop, CLOV was at $24, and I got out. Less than 24 hours later, the pump got dumped, and now CLOV is back down to $16 and falling fast. \n \nAll in all, it was a one-week play that made me 120%+, which is a fantastic return. And it wasn’t just chance. **The upside of WSB being compromised is that once you figure out how the shills operate, you can make a lot of money.** \n \nJust don’t get greedy. For CLOV, I had a limit sell placed at $25, but then I saw the price going up quickly, so I took it off. Of course, once it got to $27 it started getting dumped, so I lost out on profit by selling at $23 instead of the $25 I had predicted. \n \nDon’t try to go for a home run with pump and dumps. Try to hit a double, and if you can do that consistently, you can make a lot of money due to this broken, fucked-up shill world we live in now.', 'It doesn’t, butinstitutions are not going to buy dips and force a run up the same way retail investors do.
