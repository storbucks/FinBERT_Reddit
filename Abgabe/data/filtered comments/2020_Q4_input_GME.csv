2020-09-01,"['It’s just being willing to bet a lot of money that Tesla will be the “Apple” of EVs &amp; Self Driving Vehicles for the world, because of their ability to secure the luxury-item status in the evolving tech world. \n\nPhones were not capable of creating the richest company the world had ever seen, because phones did not do enough to justify that. Apple made the iPhone, the luxury smart phone that consolidated your life onto it, and now phones are a much more expensive item and still reasonably priced because of all the things they now replace.\n\nCar technology, especially in standard cars is lagged behind the current tech. I paid $17,000 for my car (2017 Nissan) that has no touch screen, old school buttons and knobs or any sensors or anything to keep me safe or allow me to multitask, or allow me to do anything besides drive (legally).  I paid $1000 for my smart phone which replaced HUNDREDS of items I used to have to buy separately in 2005. So it is possible that if the shift in the auto industry is geared towards who can provide the best, most reliable tech, that allows the most multitasking/easy/safety/whatever the future demands.... for all we know, self drivers might be so good, it could become unsafe to drive it yourself, decrease insurance, save on fuel, etc etc it is very likely that whoever takes cars to where Tesla is trying to take them as the luxury or Apple of Cars, they might be the next dominant force of the world.\n\nTesla is winning the competition for luxury status of these types of cars currently. But who knows when the shift will happen. The sooner the better for Tesla, the farther away, the less likely the are to become the Luxury segment of the new great consolidator. I would def throw money long term on an EV ETF. \n\nI have no money on Tesla, but I do have fomo. Wish I would have bought and sold. But definitely would have sold by now. Who knows? Will be interesting no matter what.', ""Hey sorry to jump in last minute, as a dev on both engines there's one thing I'd factor in - which is market strategy and retail sentiment not really caring about dev sentiment.  \n\n\nUnity is a fantastic game engine that is infinitely more flexible than UE, and I love UE, however the business model doesn't scale like Epic and their market penetration into non-games is not as robust. I just don't believe that a non-dev investor's DD is going to signal confident buys on it.\n\nEpic is employing differentiation focuses on various industry segments, and recouping by how successful each client is. That means that if you're in Film, UE is great for pre-vis, if you are building cars, UE is great for pre-vis/deterministic sims etc, hell if you are building an Oil Refinery, UE is great for arch-vis. So enterprise licenses are different, sure, but they're also priced at higher than Unity's highest enterprise license - and they require the project to talk to Epic Enterprise first and may have caveats for external client projects. That means games AA-AAA, they're getting percentage of revenue, whilst they're offering premium prices for enterprise. Enterprise, especially film, is becoming a significant focus for Epic. I believe they'll be soon focusing on LED-screen standardization/training, as well as expanding on their virtual-production tools. Data-smith and big-data visualization are also getting traction in some enterprise ventures, I know that for companies in Defense and Infrastructure Data-smith was a big interest point.  \n\n\nUnity's model is on cost-focus, to offer the best value for development at fixed cost, across all sectors universally (as far as I know). That to me means that even the large-scale mobile revenue coming in is capping out at seats, instead of runaway percentage earnings on a hit, and Epic is still charging higher in enterprise \\*if\\* the project qualifies for the enterprise program and throwing more dollars at capturing a higher market share in non-games. Film, Defense and Industrial Design are markets with a lot of potential, and I'm likely ignorant to it but I just haven't really seen Unity make similar headways into non-games.  \n\n\nFor development I'd certainly advocate Unity for mobile, indie or not-an-FPS game, but for business investment Epic certainly has a more attractive model. Alone I'd build in Unity, but throw my money to an Epic IPO."", ""I think they *could*. If there's any company around now that has the potential to do that in the next 15 to 20 years, I think it's Tesla.

That idea doesn\'t look that fleshed out to me. How exactly are people arriving at that conclusion? By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn\'t say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn\'t have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year.

I'll take that into account next time with the formatting. \n\nAs for the margin expansions, Amazon currently is suffering from costs associated with fulfillment, deliveries, and new tech content (both AWS and Prime). Given how well they were able to manage both their gross margins and EBITDA margins historically, and has seen dramatic improvement in the last 5 years proved to us that they have the capabilities to become more efficient with their operations as they scale. Given that assumption, their costs as a function of revenues should decrease over time till the terminal year. On top of that, we believe that by year 5, they will have an entirely new business which is shipping and delivers. This is because of their purchases of a air fleet, truck fleet, and contract LMD drivers. This essentially will offset a good chunk of their current expenses and by doing so will also widen their margins.   \nI would personally disagree with AWS's business life cycle as they currently are not in their infant stages nor are they in mature stage yet. I'd say they still have huge growth potentials as they expand their services more worldwide. The only caveat with AWS is competition from other companies such as GOOGLE and Microsoft which I briefly touched on in the blog post but also in our numbers. Their growth by our terminal year will drop off. We could be entirely wrong but given how much better of a service AWS provides above Microsoft and GOOGLE, they for sure will keep their market dominance, at least in the near future.   \nAs for retail, the revenue drop off to us was due to the huge growth of Prime in the last several years. It can be seen in the prime member numbers and the prime spending surplus. There is also a compounding factor, and that is Amazon's third party sellers are more and more involved in prime which, you are entirely right, we did a poor job in explaining this phenomenon. As these third party sellers sell more prime associated products or products with prime status, they sink into prime's revenue segments. With our revenue breakdowns, all revenues coming from retail segment is purely third party generated meaning that Amazon has almost nothing to do with it (expect them being the intermediary between buyer and seller). As for the future, we believe that prime products will simply dwarf retail products and here is why. Jeff has made it in recent years incredibly hard to compete on Amazon without a prime status. This means if your product does not have prime, you will be bumped further down the page list, your product is less featured, and consumers will be less inclined to buy your product because it does not have free shipping nor will it be delivered in 1 day. This essentially forces sellers to become prime certified or else they will get destroyed in the Amazon ecosystem. That is why pure retail sales will shrink and prime will grow because Jeff has made the structure of his business like that. Given how much he obeses over customer convivence, it makes sense as to why he wants all third party sellers to be selling with a prime statues.  \n\nCapex: AWS is not the only spender of capex. Not even close. Their largest investments currently are in their warehouses (operating leases) and logistics. Next comes their tech and content which encompasses both prime and AWS. The reason we linked capex directly with revenues is because they are symbiotic. The more Amazon earns, the more they reinvest that money back into the company. So in essence, their capex should be a function of their revenues. Please let me know if there is another method of doing this. \n\nthanks for reading, I hope I cleared up your questions."", 'Yet they let in Etsy, who just did a whopping 400bn revenue in a quarter where the government mandated that everyone has to shop online and whose most popular product segment will get quashed by copyright issues if they actually grow any larger.', 'Gamestop should be fun.', 'Hey, thanks so much for reading and providing such a thorough set of feedback. I checked out your post, and to be totally honest, I’d be doing you a disservice if I claimed I could speak to the manufacturing processes with as much detail as you did in your piece. That was simply beyond the scope of my research. While I do recognize that manufacturing is an important part of the story, having worked in a manufacturing intensive industry I can definitely say that it’s impossible to know what steps are being taken internally to address these issues and how effective they are. \n\nI always am wary when the main value-added of a particular business model is supposedly to manufacturing process. There is nothing proprietary about a manufacturing process and nothing to stop a competitor from adopting the same approach to enhance their product production. If you are correct that the consensus is signaling one way to produce, I don’t see a reason why Intel with the same level of in-house engineering/purchasing talent wouldn’t be able to resolve these issues. Not saying that happens overnight, but this is a long-term piece and I think the market/analysts are overly focused on the immediate term. \n\nAs for Mobileye, I’m not sure that’s entirely true about L2 to L5. The latest Tesla Computer and EyeQ 5 both support L5 but are being used for 2+/3 capabilities. The real prohibitor in having L5 today is a combination of the overall hardware for full autonomy costing $10-15k and being too expensive to adapt to a consumer vehicle; 2) regulatory frameworks; 3) broad consumer acceptance. I know that’s repeating a line from the piece, but on a technical basis L5 will be possible as soon as the software advances to a point where it can handle the workloads - and that’s not really that far off. My goal wasn’t to suggest Mobileye will replicate 70% market share in L5 but to rather point out that Intel is practically excluded from the conversation as being a player and that shouldn’t be the case. Also, Nvidia is often cited and their AV push is one of the end markets that are regularly touted as making them a differentiator when Mobileye has a much strong competitive positioning in the space. I think the market is missing this completely. \n\nAs for Tiger Lake, I really think we need independent testing. But there are also a couple of things we already know: 50 OEM designs are shipping this fall with 150 expected by next year. People on Reddit and in this thread are overly focused on people building their own PCs or people who are aware of the benchmark differences between Ryzen and Tiger Lake when that’s just such a fractional percentage of the user market for ultra-thin high performance. And despite all of the various issues at Intel and all of the so-called domination by AMD the past couple of years, their share of the PC market is only 20%. I think that speaks directly to my point about the composition of the market itself, and as Intel muscles its way into more design ranges, I think it’s likely to put a ceiling on AMD market share advances for the time being. \n\nI think the community gets so caught up with the truly amazing turnaround by AMD (I wrote a post saying as much a couple months ago) and the conversation gets distorted into AMD having a lead when market share figures just don’t remotely suggest that. That leads me to the server discussion. I believe in your analysis your wrote about the higher core count and how Intel won’t be capable of matching AMD on that with Xeon, but that’s not how customers choose their components. It’s all about price-per-performance. They aren’t simply putting one 128 core EPYC and calling it a day. In the case of Cloudflare selecting EPYC for their new GenX server, they specifically mentioned how they chose 64 over 128 because the performance advantage was marginal for a much higher price. When you think about the volumes that these are being purchased in for edge providers/hyperscale cloud vendors, that point only gets compounded. \n\nThis is directly addressed in the write-up, where AMD had a massive lead on price-per-performance until the Xeon refresh. And I think that’s a huge reason why you’ve seen them get design wins and boost market share in data center. But again - their market share is only 10% all the while they have had this price advantage, thread count advantage, etc. So how can that be the case? Ultimately this is why I disagree about the data-centric segment being a misnomer, because they are independent markets insofar as the purchasing strategies and rationale. \n\nI think what happens most times is that folks get caught up on the technical factors when the people who are making these decisions are not engineers - they are buyers. Yes, the buyers get counseled by their technical teams but that’s just one element of it. B2B relationships, upgrade/vendor change risk, single-vendor risk, contract terms, and many more non-technical factors drive these decisions just as much if not more. And considering servers are exclusively an enterprise buyer versus the PC being a consumer buy, I think it would be a mistake to lump these together. I do business development and strategy, and I’ve been in these conversations. I just have yet to see a compelling alternative explanation for how AMD has 10% market share in data center despite everything you covered. \n\nAs for the edge server specifically, I think GPU is a wild card as you could totally be right. But edge servers will also greatly expand demand for CPU and  storage. I think the conversation on here and elsewhere is stuck in the past where there is one winner and one loser. The market is going to be too large for that, and it will absolutely require two players at least. As I said, single-vendor risk is a real thing in all industries but especially IT. It’s why Azure was able to claw out a sizeable #2 position in IaaS/PaaS when years before everyone said the “cloud wars” were over and AWS was the undisputed king. The quantities and demand is too large for one player to dominate. And because of that, I think edge servers is a trend that will lift both boats. But IoT is a different use case and integrated/hybrid graphics will be much more applicable for that type of device. So graphics could see a boost there as well. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think the conversation is inverted. People expect Intel to lose market share in legacy businesses while Nvidia and AMD are carving out dominant positions in higher-growth end markets. But Intel is also in those same end markets, and in some cases Intel has the dominant position at present. And even in the event they lose market share, these markets are so vast that it will still meaningfully drive Intel shares higher. My own 2023 projections of less than 5x P/S really is not that rosy considering NVDA is trading above 26x. But what if Intel doesn’t keep losing market share because of some of the factors I mentioned? Or what if they are successful with discrete GPUs? Those possibilities are priced into shares 0%. And I tend to think when the market overwhelmingly biased the narrative in one direction, if the narrative needs to correct, it causes a serious reversion in the share price - in both directions. \n\nGiven the strength of Intel’s financial performance despite the struggles, its attractive valuation, and its more aggressive push to catch up to advances by AMD, Intel offers much better downside protection relative to the hyper growth names that are exposed to the possibility of a tech correction in the near-term. All in all, comparatively lower risk for potential significant upside.', ""Great writeup. Always interesting to read the opposite view to what I hold. Your part about Mobileye in particular I agree with - I think similar to other car parts self-driving will be commoditised and produced by 3rd parties rather than in-house. I'm less certain that Mobileye will retain an industry lead in lvl5 autonomy than you - lvl2 and lvl5 are very different and it's difficult to tell who'll win imo.\n\nAs for the other parts, I don't agree with as much, and here's why.\n\n1.Tiger Lake. The benchmarks chosen are rather odd. While Tiger Lake does seem to be competitive and will claw back market share if Intel can produce in large quantities (which another commenter claims they can't), the performance uplift is nowhere near as much as they claim - all the benchmarks are cherry picked and presented in a manipulated way (I can explain more if you're interested, but yeah, wait for independents).\n\n2. The 'data-centric' vs 'PC-centric' is a misnomer in my opinion. Intel should report 'x86' and 'other' segments. Xeons are ultimately built on the same fundamentals as their PC parts, and underperformance in PC is a leading indicator of underperformance in datacentre CPUs. I explained [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) a few weeks ago why Intel's datacentre CPUs will, in my opinion, never be competitive with AMD on 10nm, and Tiger Lake's performance does nothing to change my argument.\n\n3. Edge computing is definitely very interesting, and likely to expand the 'pie' of servers quite significantly. I agree with your analysis that it even a marginal percentage of the market will be significant for Intel, but I doubt their Xe graphics will be able to make any impact. Nvidia's software stack is an incredibly strong moat, and CUDA is going to keep Intel firmly out.\n\nI'd be interested on your views on mine/my post"", ""You are adding nothing to the discussion because you know their revenues in those segments is miniscule and shrinking.\n\nYou are regurgitating fanboy talking points you don't even agree with!"", ""Standard fanboy line.\n\nRevenue fell year over year in their non-auto business.

Some contrarian arguments to OPs points:\n\n1) disney's actual revenue streams have historically been from 2 segments. Parks/resorts and media. When I say media, I mean ABC and ESPN. Their other major segments (again, historically) have been propped up by these 2 segments as they are boom/bust segments, that specifically operate in the consumer cyclical sector. This is studios and international\n\n2) The new segment that OP mentions, direct to consumer, is new and unproven. As a longtime stockholder of DIS, I hope it does well for me. However, as a contrarian, some real threats to this segment are very tangible. But first, threats to DIS cash cows of parks and media:\n\nA vaccine that actually works won't be out by early November. That's way too soon for a vaccine to be safe. The second wave of this virus is just getting started come fall/winter of 2020. People are not going to suddenly come back to Disneyland as early as this fall or winter, that's going to be a very delayed rebound for the parks sector to have appreciable revenue growth, even given its dominant position in the sector pre covid. If we look back to parks/experiences revenue during the 2008 crisis, it wasnt until late 2011 that people felt confident enough to spend their discretionary budget on a frivolous pursuit such as a disneyland experience, and that's ignoring the double whammy effect of a recession and a pandemic, and how that will play out on the parks segment. I hope youre right OP, but I think this will take longer to rebound than you think.  \n\nAnd the media segments revenue come from 2 parts, ABCs advertising stream and ESPNs subscriber base. Good luck with both of those things, I suppose espn will have a lifeline from sports all fans that don't mind watching a game without any audience, maybe. But the sports industry will have a strange time getting back to the business of having games during a pandemic. And ABC....what do people watch on ABC again? \n\nThose are disney's historic blockbuster segments that help fund their other ventures.\n\nWhich brings me to streaming/direct to consumer. The new segment. There is real tangible reason for optimism here, and I'm optimistic too, as a stockholder. If you have kids and you have to homeschool them now ... Who's the babysitter while you're working from home? If you have younger kids that just want to watch frozen on repeat....D+ is the answer. But the real threat is that there are only so many kids in the US and the world, and adults (like me, and probably like you too) get really bored of disney's content after 1 month and unsubscribe. And in a world where everyone and their mother has a streaming service, why maintain loyalty to one, unless you have kids? Their over-crowded direct to consumer segment is growing on a daily basis with competition, and being overwhelmed with an abundance of choices can occasionally not be a good thing."", ""Disney+ does not make up for the lost revenues of theme park and cinema closures. Plus, it is not a profitable segment for Disney. One of the biggest lies that goes around Reddit is that Disney+ will somehow make up for all of Disney's other struggles."", ""With tight control over the older, classic content that will maintain a baseline level of demand, there is a lot of runway for D+ to add more content. For a small group of parents, it is indispensable. For specific fiction fans, this is the case as well. These segments are relatively sustainable and stable. The growth potential comes through the improvements in their libraries over time and the cache of their exclusive releases.\n\nA ton of the current subscriber are on free trials or great bundle deals (Hulu+, ESPN+, D+ for 12.99), and many will drop off. The current climate is fortuitous for Disney in their streaming and provides opportunity to use data, learn, and improve the product offering. Remember, if they want to burn billions on content like Netflix, Disney's ability to borrow (like Netflix does) is strong. All this will transpire while it's physical business slowly recovers post-pandemic.\n\nI am long.""]"

2020-09-10,"[""Correct. Indirect competitors would be companies who offer other outdoor/leisure accessories, but not specifically drinkwear or coolers. Think golf club socks, grill accessories, branded hats, or beach chairs, for example.\n\nAs far as splitting out accessories sales from the company's greater sales, you possibly could, but I'd say that that's more legwork than you need to do. Doing so would require you to dig pretty deeply into the financials to understand how much of the company's Operating Profit + Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA, in other words) is derived from that specific accessories segment. It is a very subjective endeavor and would also require you to make some very tricky assumptions about how much of the company's stock price reflects that individual segment, how much of the balance sheet (and debt) is attributed to the accessories segment, and what the accessories growth segment looks like. And in a company like Polaris, accessories are probably not the main driver of its gross profit base. I'd guess it's ATV sales that serve as the anchor to the accessories, i.e., accessories rise and fall concurrently with the company's ATV sales. Same with the boatmakers' and golf club makers' accessories businesses. Consumers wouldn't likely buy a Polaris sun visor unless they also owned a Polaris ATV.\n\nIf I were running comps against Yeti, I'd select Vista as the #1 comp (they make Camelbak, which directly competes against Yeti), along with Johnson Outdoors, Garmin, Deckers Outdoor, Columbia Sportswear, and Canada Goose Holdings. I would avoid comparing Yeti with the boat, RV and ATV makers - those are much larger capital purchases that usually come with financing. But smaller priced items like shoes or jackets are usually a close enough indirect competitor to Yeti."", ""For sure, thank you. I looked a bit deeper into its competitors and saw that many have products that compete with Yeti. I'm just trying to determine how to apply the multiples if a company, like Polaris, has most of its sales from ATV's but has a portion of sales generated from competing products, like insulated coolers. \n\nI'm assuming I would just take a weighted average of the competitor's multiple based on the % of revenue generated from the competing segment.

Engineering is all about tradeoffs generally though.  The million mile batteries CATL has use a different chemistry that's less dense from a mass perspective and incorporate some of CATL's own IP that eliminates the need to put cells into modules and helps reduce weight somewhat.  They're still likely to be less dense and cheaper though.\n\nTesla itself makes similar tradeoffs in its vehicle designs.  They focus primarily on EPA range and 0-60 speeds and that comes at the cost of some other things like sound proofing and overall ride quality or odd ball dimensions for cargo.  Tesla is also more willing to implement performance features and modes that put a massive strain on the battery and only function for a single shot.\n\nSomething like the Taycan has better performance at higher speeds than the Model S and much better repeatable acceleration, but less efficiency at lower speeds.\n\nAnother huge factor is that many of the early competitors were never built on BEV platforms but instead of adapted ICE platforms which just limits how much optimization can be done.  Stuff like the E-Tron and I-Pace were never going to get the same kind of density as a Model X and also opted for worse aerodynamics for better storage and headroom in the rear which further put them at a disadvantage.\n\nWe're finally seeing the first real crop of dedicated BEV platforms coming out in higher production numbers now with VW ID.3 launching in a matter of days and Ford's Mach-E slated to come later this year.  You also have manufacturers putting up offerings in segments that Tesla flat out doesn't compete in yet.  Especially smaller compact and subcompact cars in the EU like the Renault Zoe which compete at much lower price points.\n\nThis isn't to say that Tesla has bad offerings or doesn't have a headstart in some areas but it's usually greatly exaggerated.  Maybe they'll pull a rabbit out of the hat here on battery day but given Elon Musk's track record of exaggerating time lines and functionality on a lot of their technology it's usually better to be skeptical until something is actually being produced at volume before uncorking the champagne.""]"

The only reason for Amazon to do it would be to instantly propel themselves into the #1 market share spot because I doubt there’s anything Blue Apron could offer Amazon in terms of business expertise in this area.', ""Even if NIO has no exposure outside of China, it's ok IF it can be a major player there.

By all means, AMD is liable to grow faster in the near-term. What I’m trying to convey by comparing revenue is just how dominant INTC has actually been in the semiconductor market. Even if we assumed that AMD’s revenue would grow at 20% a year perpetually, and Intel’s at 0%, AMD wouldn’t surpass Intel in revenue for 13 years. That, in addition to their phenomenal balance sheet and high profit margins, gives Intel a significant time buffer to modernize their product line and become competitive again.\n\nAMD being fabless is a competitive disadvantage for them, not the other way around. Intel spending more on production each quarter than AMD earns in a year goes to show, again, just how massive Intel is in comparison to the competition. While INTC’s foundries have been a source of problems recently, they’re a major competitive advantage in the long-term. AMD will have much higher operating costs per unit sold than Intel, and as such, a much lower profit margin (and probably higher unit costs, so there’s that). Lower profit margins mean less flexibility in poor markets, less excess cash to invest in growth, R&amp;D, share buybacks, dividends, etc., and higher entry costs when expanding your product line. Intel is currently entering the dedicated GPU market, and already having access to foundries at a low cost will give them a strong competitive advantage in this market segment (and should they burn out in the GPU market, it at least won’t cost them too much).\n\nAs for the server market, AMD did not jump from a 1% to 8% market share in a single quarter. They’ve grown from 1.4% to 5.8% in 2 years. As an INTC investor, this doesn’t concern me. It wasn’t likely that Intel would hold a true monopoly in a fast-growing market segment forever, but they still have first-mover advantages, and over 90% of the market is controlled by Intel. A little bit of competition is healthy.\n\nI agree that Intel should modernize their products ASAP, and seeing them play catch-up with AMD in that regard is disconcerting. That being said, they have tons of time to actually do so while still maintaining their dominance, and just like I said in my original post, the market is overreacting to Intel’s struggles.', 'You can’t just look at p/e and come to a conclusive judgment from that alone, that is only part of the equation.', ""Short version: people are taking profits. \n\nFrom what I can see, earnings reports in *this* market atm always make the price go up before, for anticipation. Then, after it comes out, if it went a lot better than expected, it rises for a while (few hours, sometimes only post-market) and then falls almost immediately after open because ppl take profit. If it does better than expected, but not by much, or worse than expected, it tanks after it's out. The only recent exception to this is Zoom, all the other earnings did this (Docu, CrowdStrike, Chewy just in the last 2 or 3 weeks). \n\nI think people are in fear mode right now, so even if stg does better than expected, they take their profits and go because they don't know what to expect short term, because the market is so volatile. \n\nI have done 0 research on Peloton, so I  don't know for sure, but for what it's worth, I don't think these falls mean anything, long term.

Here are all the examples they give in the s-1 of non-gaming uses of their technology:\n\n&gt;Architecture:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For architects, transforming building development and architectural data for the 3D world has been a challenge. Seemingly small post-design changes can take months to rework. Architects, designers and project partners use this real-time 3D to simultaneously contribute to the planning and development of a building with rapid, cost-effective iteration. Onsite construction teams and technicians can visualize before, and as they build. Interactive, 3D designs can be virtually overlaid onto actual construction through augmented reality, to detect design flaws early, which significantly reduces the risk of future rebuilds and drives project efficiencies. \n\nFirst of all professional CAD tools are hellishly complex which makes the market entrenched and difficult to disrupt. Architectural tools are not where you want lots of frills and real time effects, so I'm not sure what they think they are contributing over traditional 3D cad tools in terms of planning and design stages. Existing tools are hundreds of iterations deep and have huge momentum based on their widespread use among college professors, newly graduated engineers and seasoned designers. That unity can leverage their 3d game engine to disrupt that market is laughable.\n\nThere is however the VR/AR aspect, which probably does have some merit. That said, I just don't see how much money is really worth it for an architect or designer to be able to strap on a be helmet and look at their design. Keep in mind that the target audi nice here is already comprised of people who are necessarily very good at visualizing objects and spaces from 2d schematics.\n\nAs for AR used to aid in construction, I have no doubt that it has potential to ease certain aspects of large projects. That said, setting up and maintaining accurate AR on an active build site is not a solved problem, and I'm unconvinced many builders would find the marginal benefits to be worth potentially large cost increases.\n\nThen you have this\n\n&gt;Automotive:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The automotive industry is often challenged by a long, slow development cycle for new car models. The traditional process involves disparate tools in the iterative creation and recreation of a new model. Real-time 3D technology is driving efficiencies in car development and sales cycles, allowing for interactive, life-like models of cars to be rendered in real-time. These “digital twins” can be used for marketing or personalized sales experiences at dealerships and online. \n\n\xa0Their whole argument here is basically that real time 3D and VR can be used as a sales gimmick. I think it could be useful for initial car shopping, but people are always going to want to physically sit in their cars (and test drive them) before the purchase. Of course more car shopping is being done online now due to covid, but unless the covid crisis continues for much longer than public health officials expect (passed 2021) I think unity may be too late to take advantage of that temporary market.\n\nI guess the question here is how valuable would this be as a marketing tool really? Is it worth billions of dollars to allow shoppers to pretend to sit in a car? Who owns the VR equipment in this case, the dealership or the purchaser? Does this rely on much broader VR adoption than we've seen in recent years?\n\nThen the last example they give is this:\n\n&gt;Film:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Filmmakers are finding that real-time technology yields faster results and provides more creative freedom than traditional filming and editing solutions. Real-time technology removes the need for server farms that generate single frames over hours, eliminating the need to wait days for dailies or for servers to fully render a digital scene. Because creation becomes be real-time, a filmmaker can edit and review a scene instantly, allowing higher quality productions to reach audiences more quickly. \n\nWhich honestly is the most laughable part. The implication here seems to be that unity's realtime engine will allow filmmakers to preview their work without having to wait for the full render. This is obviously invaluable when iterating visual computer generated effects and animations, which is why every professional 3D suite already has this capability. Why would you export your scene to a unity 3d tool for real time rendering when Maya [can already do this](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-Rendering/files/GUID-2FFD2E18-DEAC-4D73-8F07-082FAD5B4A16-htm.html)? The only way into this market for unity is either to replace Autodesk's existing real time renderer (which would be expensive and hold no benefit for Autodesk) or replace tools such as Maya and others entirely (which again would be hellishly expensive and time consuming)\n\nTL;DR \n\nThe market just isn't as big as unity claims it is, and the examples of non-game applications are far from convincing."", ""Stocks are an odd animal; more often than not you risk $1.50 to potentially make $2.25, but you always keep in the back of your mind that you can lose that entire $1.50.\n\nSuccessful stock traders only invest money that they understand can be lost.

Just be aware you may be missing out on non-tech opportunities.', ""This is a good note, although to me it comes off as slightly biased way of just defending TESLA runups on Wall Street Bets. Maybe it’s my ego since I have been using P/E a lot lately as a value oriented comparison to question TSLA as a wise retail/individual investor play.\n\nThe main OP take away - that I strongly support - is that serious investors need to a*ccess, process and address* every aspect of a company’s books and financial sheet,as well as the their market's, to make rationally defensible trades. If any of the terms and elements discussed are not actively understood and visible to YOU you are not going to make good decisions about higher risk stocks, period.\n\nMost of the people who own stocks, globally, do so via funds diverted from their real job’s payroll plans and they have no fucking idea what any of this means. And that is ok.  However, I think most of the people in here are intelligent, awake, and capable but many are just young or inexperienced investors.\n\nI think P/E is a safe reference for the former and the best possible first deep dive for the later.\n\nThe stock market today as seen on WALL STREET BETS offers youngish people, who I strongly feel are facing a new, historic and justified loss of faith in the whole system, the oldest ruse in the history of trade: A no-experience-needed short cut to wealth.  Which they feel they might not otherwise have access too anytime soon.\n\nOptions trading is exciting but at some point real money is being lost and gained and real lives are being strained. You wanna swim with the sharks you better learn to hold your breath and read some charts. P/E is an entry level analysis tool that opens doors to deeper diving and it is so because it is a very solid  (even if overly simple) indicator of key elements of public company’s success trends.\n\n..\n\nAlmost all companies progress through start-up, venture funding, IPO, Growth and Value stages. That is the goal after all. That progression is the underlayer of this discussion to me.   BTW: Value companies do seek growth and are expected to deliver it but at the margins of their established success and thus with lower risk of decline than in the other stages.\n\nAs companies claw up towards stability and value status the risks and rewards of investing are proportionally reduced. So to is the sophistication needed to evaluate investments. Using P/E alone is dumbassery for start up fund managers but perfectly wise for successful lawyers or teachers or for new, learning investors. My comments and encouragement is more directed at inexperienced reddit learners.\n\nThe reason why P/E IS an excellent first look for the inexperienced is partially that it offers an individual with limited training, experience or time a loud bright reference indicator showing what stage of corporate evolution a company is at and how successful it has been at arriving and transiting the established stages.\n\nThe stages of every public company’s evolution also parallel the category of investors who might be rationally (sanely) expected to buy the stock.\n\nThis is THE key point being danced around here imo. It is the whole cherry bomb of the Robinhood / Wall Street Bets thrill ride. Who should YOLO TSLA a week out and who should buy Wal Mart Shares and go back to their day jobs.\n\nSophisticated high risk investors would be laughed at for using PE as a sole gauge but learning investors are wise to use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTESLA, for reference, is obviously navigating the transition from wild assed start-up to safe strong mainstream powerhouse. As the company evolves so to does the base of proper investors.  The change in this base is as much a part of the volatility as the change in perceived value of he company.  High risk reward experts are wisely selling out  at their top.  Low risk/reward amateurs are wisely getting in at their bottom. The price making volatility for this ongoing transition will be fun to watch but dangerous for amateurs to time.\n\nStock drops like today's don’t mean TSLA is in trouble, fuck it is amazing, it just means that risk/reward balances for investing in it are evolving as the company matures. The short term win scenarios are shrinking and the long term stability scenarios are expanding. Everyone is actually wining, in other words.\n\nTheir P/E reflects the chaos of the change in class of stock owner as much as the change in phase of the company. Average P/E  over time, prior to march 2020 or so,  is much less dramatic than short term P/E. Part of that is also because they have actually *organically started to generate earnings for the first time in company history*. It's still fighting through the pre-growth and post start up phases.\n\nThe company is great, whether YOU should buy their stock (or options) is the only doubt. And, as the OP notes, if P/E is still your sharpest tool, it might not be your best choice for YOLO immersion. But if you are defending 500 a share *with* this P/E you might be equally error prone. There are two sides to every trade and both sides can be wrong! I do think TSLA depends on the trader more than the trade right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who buy value stocks do not make their money by investing in the stock market. They make their money running small businesses, serving in the military or working for The Man. The stock investments they most rationally (ie: should) favor are about protecting and preserving the wealth they acquire in other areas. The standard reference for these investors is an emphasis on beating inflation+interest rates as the approximate bench mark of success.  Is it better than burying money in a coffee can?  Growth of wealth in the market is a secondary goal for these investors (you perhaps) since they make their money doing other stuff. Real, achievable and significant expansion of wealth over time is possible even likely, but it remains secondary to preserving their already-made personal savings.\n\nDown at the other end, people who invest in Start-Up, Pre Ipo funding, IPO stake holding and into growth trajectory stages are professional investors. They risk everything they wager, every time they invest, and so they are wise to manage their risk with detailed sophistication and deep pocketed complexity (in theory). Their goal is to ensure the very few winners they invest in are big fucking winners. These people are not business owners, professional workers, Military careerists etc.. They are professional investors and DOING THIS IS THEIR CAREER.\n\nThey are the ones who rightfully laugh at 25 year old tsla call purchasers YOLOing on a whim. For them the use of something like P/E as prime metric is obviously highly incompetent.\n\nBut, Investing for retail (amateur or inexperienced) level individuals demands acknowledgment that we do not understand most of the basics of reading a financial sheet and have no detailed understanding of our own goals other than to print some money.\n\nP/E is both very useful and totally valid for most of these amateur or retail investors on several levels.\n\nFirst off it is probably the best tool to use if you only use one tool.\n\nNext is it the first financial reference that most people learn to understand - and it is pretty easy to understand after a few reads.\n\nAnother way to see P/E  is like a ratio of sales to promise. A P/E of 500 means, to me, it has 500 times more promise than sales. Maybe a great opportunity to buy and hold but also maybe a Nikola truck full of Theranos blood testing machines.. Risks are definitely higher, rewards might be higher, investor sophistication should be higher.\n\nFurther it reflects if the company is well managed as an investment during the transition or stage it occupies. Growth companies should have higher P/Es, sure. But a P/E of 2000 is a reflection that something has lurched or been neglected until it is out of balance.    Either the number of shares floated has not been attended to meet the demands of the appropriate investors or, the company is still focussed more on promises than sales. Neither reality is definitely bad but both require a sophisticated deep dive and thus a truly qualified investor to suss out. (This relates to TSlA rushing to add float/ sell more shares in recent weeks: IMHO they got way the fuck behind in managing that element and it does raise some management risk concerns.)\n\nIf you buy a 500 P/E company you are betting it will gain more buyer demand than a 25 P/E company will. You aren’t buying the company, you are buying the stock.  P/E is a clear reference to how likely the market is to want to buy that stock from you at a future profit. Your investment will only be as valuable as the rest of the stock market players think the STOCK (or option) is when you want or need to sell.\n\nThe P/E is the most basic element that has to increase in perceived strength for your stock purchase today to be worth more to another buyer tomorrow. Will the P/E improve when you own it? Will the company progress to be attractive to the next level of buyer?  Will the P/E  be attractive for the buyer you need to sell to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Sorry this is so long, but I think it might be useful to one or two people so I'll post it."", ""To be 100% honest I did very little research into their books before buying shares. I did enough to see that they are profitable and don't have any allegations of something bad (Nikola). I bought it based off my experience with Corsair and how other people view Corsair.\n\nI don't know how much you know about PC building, so I'll go over what I see from the beginning.\n\nFirst, PC builders can be crazy sometimes, myself included. That needs to be accepted right away. Spending hundreds of extra dollars for aesthetically pleasing parts (which Corsair specializes in) is common. \n\nSecond, Corsair is always at the forefront of trends in PC building that increase their appeal and market share. Most notably, in the past few years RGB lighting has grown very popular and also tempered glass computer cases. Corsair was one of the first to get in on the trend, and is even further developed those trends.\n\nThird, they have very high quality products. Their keyboards, cases, RAM, mice, etc are all extremely good and competitive with any other company. Just look up a Corsair computer case compared to basically any other company. Nine times out of 10 the Corsair case will look the best, going back to my first point which is that people pay for aesthetics. Same can be said for their RAM, keyboards, and mice. They all work very well and are some of, if not the, best, but you are in part paying for the brand and look.\n\nLast, they have built a very loyal following because of their high quality and always being at the front of trends.\n\nCorsair is dominating the products that they make, so it only makes sense that they start expanding into other products. I don't think that we will ever see a Corsair CPU, but I honestly think that it would be a no brainer for Corsair to partner with a company such as Asus to have their name on motherboards and graphics cards. I know I would be tempted to buy it and so would many other people just for the fact that they would be able to sync all of their lighting in their computer. And we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nI know a lot of people won't buy a stock just cause they like the company. But, I feel like with how Corsair has dominated the segment for each of their products they will continue to gain market share and it is inevitable that they will eventually expand into other products, making them more money.\n\nI'm not going to hold the shares I bought today forever, in fact I plan on selling them by the end of the week. But I will certainly be trading Corsair in the future as I think their valuation will certainly be increasing in the years to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Corsair makes some of the best computer products and has a crazy fanbase.

Instead, 60% of my assets are in a passive risk parity strategy (the US equity component is benchmarked to S&amp;P500). I use an algorithmic trading system and discretionary trades (that targets a 8% volatility, overlaid on the US equity allocation) that have beaten the S&amp;P500 by 81bps annualized over the last 8 years. \n\nWhile I have not explicitly compared My VC portfolio (~20%) to the S&amp;P500 (didn't take the time to match cash flows on the spreadsheet), it's trounced the S&amp;P500 by a large margin primarily driven by 2 very lucky investments that were  outsized. Excluding those, I *roughly* lose maybe 200-300bps annualized to the S&amp;P500 (it's meaningful, though I contend VC is about finding that big tail outcome).

More covid? They win, less covid they win. Mom and pop stores close they win, new market segment they win.', 'Not a study, but [A Journey to Indexville](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/05/indexville/) addresses this question directly from first principles and comes to some interesting conclusions.\n\n&gt;\t- The right size of the active segment of the market is the size that allows it to earn whatever fees it charges.  If it cannot earn those fees, then there will always be an arbitrage opportunity putting pressure on its size.  Investors will be able to get higher returns by going passive, and so that’s what they’ll do.\n\n&gt;\t- The only way the active segment, as a group, can earn its fees, is by providing liquidity to the market, specifically to the passive segment, and to corporations seeking new funding.  All other profits for the segment will be zero-sum.\n\n&gt;\t- The question that determines the necessary amount of active management is this: how much natural passive flow is there in the system, i.e., non-speculative flow associated with people wanting to save excess income, or wanting to consume out of savings, or wanting to alter their risk allocations, given changes in their ages?  Similarly, what is the natural corporate demand for funding?  That flow, and that demand for funding, represents active management’s potential market for the provision of liquidity.  Relative to the actual volume that takes place in the current market, it is minimal.\n\n&gt;\t- If the investing ethos evolves such that market participants become decreasingly inclined towards active behaviors–i.e., if they learn their lessons, and stop making trades for speculative reasons, and instead take the sage advice of a Bogle, or a Malkiel, or a Fama to limit their interventions to cases where they have legitimate non-speculative reasons for modifying their portfolios–then the active segment will have to shrink dramatically from its current size.  Either that, or it will have to shrink its fees.\n\n&gt;\t- At some point in the above scenario–which, to be clear, is the Indexville scenario–the system will get to down to some bare-bones minimum level of active management, a level at which active managers, as a group, will be small enough to earn excess profits that are sufficient to cover the percentage-based fees they charge.  Where is that minimum level?  In my view, far away from the current level, at least at current fee rates.  If I had to randomly guess, I would say somewhere in the range of 5% active, 95% passive.  If we include private equity in the active universe, then maybe the number is higher–say, 10% active, 90% passive.\n\n&gt;\t- On the other hand, if we assume that the trend towards “passive investing” is simply about investors in the current bull market falling in love with $SPY or $VFIAX given the recent performance of U.S. equities, rather than about investors actually committing to the advice of a Bogle, or a Malkiel, or a Fama–then the future liquidity that those investors will consume when they change their minds will provide opportunities for what we’re calling the “active segment” to step in and earn its fees.  But this point will be purely definitional, because the investors we are calling “passive”, though technically passive relative to the S&amp;P 500, will not have been genuinely passive at all, in terms of the spirit of what that term means.  They will have been active investors operating in guise, who just-so-happened to have been using index-based instruments in their efforts.', 'They don’t have to win every segment.

There are a set of rules that can be used to describe nearly every driving circumstance that just get very esoteric toward the long tail of circumstances that are important for successfully completing trips.   But this does not mean you need a “moral” thinking machine to perform fully autonomous driving.\n\nIt’s also important to note that failure *is* an option when it comes to autonomy - there will be accidents.  People will die.  But as long as the total accident rate goes down it is a net good.  So no, passing regulation won’t be as hard as you’re making it out to be.  Even a flawed self driving machine will be significantly better than most people driving on the road.', 'Not really.\n\nI buy a house (the device) in a city (virtual space) and normally I can expect to go be able to get a bluray/game/etc. (the app) from Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Gamestop, the locally owned game store, order it online, etc.; however, all the retail stores within an hour or two drive are the same Apple Store.\n\nThe anticompetitive practices allowed in the area ensure no competing stores are accessible and your only choice is the Apple store.\n\n""Hmmm... should I go to Apple Store or Apple Store?""

The past return average may have nothing to do with the future. \n\nIf you have an estimate of the average market return that is substantially higher than the average of the investors, you will consistently find stocks to be overpriced. In other words, the average investor is demanding ~5% for the average level of risk, but you are demanding the same high returns of the past, ~10%. \n\nHere is the interesting part: when you use the ~10% then, you are making two judgments: one judgement on the company (the cash flows) and one judgement on the market (that you think is massively overpriced, as implied in your ERP). \n\nDamodaran suggests isolating your judgement about the company from your judgment about the market. His logic is that he is not a macro economist, so he accepts the market estimate of future returns. He concentrates his effort on a proper judgment of the company only (and therefore, he uses the market driven ERP estimate). \n\nIn my mind, it’s like the “tare” function in a scale. Using the market driven ERP is like zeroing the scale where I weight the company value. \n\nNow, how he calculates the implied ERP? In summary, he takes the market consensus of future aggregate earnings of the S&amp;P500 to calculate an aggregate cash flow. He thens calculate which discount factor is equivalent to the current value of the index (what is the IRR of the index). This IRR minus the risk free rate is the implied ERP—how much, on average, the average investor is demanding for the current level of the index).']"

Comparing this to amazon is comical.', ""I think NVDA and AMD are fairly valued compared to each other, but incredibly overvalued compared to Intel. NVDA/AMD are likely also fairly or undervalued compared to the broader markets - which are grossly overvalued.\n\nFor AMD - they will soon be revenue constrained based on TSMC capacity. ATM, it looks like they're selling everything they produce. As more and more of their sales mix shifts to TSMC fabs, they will become more constrained. Even with the better products, they will only ever be able to grow revenue by a predictable amount. They're consistent, but with this constraint in place, I don't know how you can justify their current valuation.\n\nNVDA - I think they are currently worth more than INTC, while INTC makes twice the operating income that NVDA makes in total revenue. Not only this, but INTC is actually still growing revenue. \n\nThe whole TAM is expanding, such that even though NVDA and AMD have comparable or superior products, INTC is actually still growing at a respectable pace and generating considerably more revenue and profit. Part of this comes down to the fact that INTC is less supply constrained - huge fab space. Part of this is that even though AMD products are generally superior, they aren't superior for the average consumer - i.e. people buying laptops for general work, people buying desktops for general work. INTC wins in gaming, but AMD works in productivity (parallel workloads), but has a worse software stack.\n\nNVDA is growing in the server space, but not unperturbed. Competition is growing faster than NVDA is improving, and this space will be under attack in the coming half-decade. On the gaming front, NVDA is seeing it's gap close against AMD, but NVDA still has a far superior software stack. INTC is entering the GPU space in both server and consumer segments. This will still take them time, but in this time, they'll likely also remedy a lot of their FAB issues.\n\nOverall, I think AMD and NVDA have more downside than upside risk atm. They're both very vulnerable to competition, fighting for fab space and very vulnerable to any trade issues (fabs are overseas).\n\nJust my own thoughts, though."", ""I'm onboard the gme train.

It's hard to shake a stigma once it's established, and tell me one luxury car brand from China that's loved across the world? Do you know who makes cars for Nio?

Even pornography, as much as I hate to say it,  is started around ages 6-7 now.

Obviously for a brand like PGA Tour it makes sense to advertise on ESPN and CBS Sports, etc so they might contact these sites directly to buy ads. However, buying direct has several drawbacks for both advertisers and vendors. For advertisers, it makes it difficult to optimize away from less efficient media and towards more efficient media because your budgets are locked in on single buys with a single vendor. For vendors, they may not be able to sell all of their ad space all the time if theyre a more niche website. Enter programmatic media.\n\nIn the programmatic space there are two main systems. The supply side platform   (SSP) is where vendors like Hulu or ESPN.com list ad space for sale. The demand side platform is where advertisers place their buys. Advertisers are able to specify what kind of content they want to appear in, what kind of demos they want to serve against, which metrics they want to optimize against, etc as well as how much money they want to pay (on a \'cost per thousand impressions\' or CPM basis) and how many impressions they want to buy. The DSP then goes to the marketplace and looks for inventory which fits the requested criteria and bids on those ads. If the advertisers\' requested CPM range is higher than the range set by other advertisers bidding on the same as space, the website will serve their ad and they will pay one penny more than the next highest bidder (think ebay-style auctions). All of this bidding happens in the seconds while the web page is loading. The advantage of programmatic media is that budgets are set within the DSP which allows advertisers to optimize towards the better performing segments, targets, websites, etc. It also means they\'re typically able to buy inventory cheaper than they would through a direct buy. For vendors it\'s advantageous because it means they sell all of their inventory.\n\nThe Trade Desk is one of the bigger small guys in the DSP world. It\'s a sector dominated by Google\'s Display &amp; Video 360 platform (something like 40-50% market share) with everyone else with &lt;10% market share. Trade Desk is somewhere around #5 with ~5% market share last I looked, however everyone I know who works in the industry is well aware of the platform and most of them have worked in it at some point or another. Definitely a company with a lot of growth potential in an exploding sector that seems poised to make good on that potential in the next 5 years.\n\nEDIT: Should also note that they are also an ad server, meaning advertisers can upload their banners, videos, whatever to TTD and when an advertisement loads on a webpage it\'s actually opening another web element which displays the ad on TTDs domain (if you ever see your status bar display something like ""doubleclick.google.com..."" while it\'s loading a page, that means the page is loading an ad that is served by Google). I dont know of anyone who uses their ad server though.

But guess what? A lot of those advantages are worthless when you switch away from their specialty (making Internal Combustion Engine vehicles) and over to a new thing, EV\'s.\n\n* Those factories and their equipment are highly specialized to make ICE vehicles. Some of their stuff can be repurposed to switch to EV\'s, but a lot of their stuff is no good for EV\'s. \n\n* Workers also need retrained to build and maintain EV\'s, since it\'s a radically different thing then ICE vehicles they\'re used to. Worse yet, because there\'s less moving parts in EV\'s, and less that can go wrong, a lot of those workers are going to lose their jobs.

Million mile battery! Stock go up now!”, it was much more of a thought out 3, 5 and even 10 year plans.\n  \nFirst, they are going to be manufacturing their own battery cells that they designed from the ground up for efficiency and cost.

They cell also completely redesigns joe cells are assembled and designed, all in an effort to increase performance and reduce cost.\n  \nThey also laid out plans that are already in place of how they will own and operate their own mines and facilities to mine the raw materials and then refine and manufacture.\n  \nThey gave a sneak peek on a new model coming down the road that will be in the 20-25k range. This is going to be possible with the cost reduction they are putting into batteries and other home grown components.\n  \nPerhaps one of the biggest takeaways I had was a very small segment on home appliances.

Whatever you do, don't buy a bunch right now and then sell them when the market eventually crashes in the next 15 years. Do not do that. If you put money in, do not take it out during the next dip.

This is higher than the operating margin of the business sold (21,4%). By selling this business and assuming all else stays constant (TTM data), their operating margin will 34,3%. \n\nIt seems like Intel wants to focus on highly lucrative business and I don't think the 'other business' growth we have seen so far is included in the price.

I don\'t think that every GS console SKU that purchases a game will funnel 14% to GS. There is a lot of talk about CAC and Lifetime value on the call but not many specifics.

I am not even saying this is what I would actually do but rather that is an approach I might start examining if I had already decided I wanted to sell premium on GME. I would only do this approach if it was an underlying asset I don't mind holding for a bit. for example I had a similar thing going with AMD awhile back and between the merger rumors and the overall market dip I am expecting it will take at least another 15-30 days(quite possibly longer) before I'll get a good chance to unload the position. but I don't mind owning AMD right now because I think it is a solid stock that I am perfectly fine holding for a couple years if need be.\n\ngenerally as a rule of thumb is most of the premium decay on an option contract occurs during the last few days so if you are just trying to pocket premiums shorter is usually better. as you get close to things such as earnings dates the IV can shoot up and it starts to be more worthwhile to consider selling a longer term contract. you may also want to consider longer term if you have other goals in mind with the contract(for example selling an ITM call hedge against a drop while you wait for shares to become long term capital gains or for a new tax year due to your particular tax planning)"", 'Thanks for posting this write up.

Waymo has driverless taxis in extremely limited areas, for example, GM has cruise, Zoox was recently acquired by Amazon, Intel owned Mobileye also has huge amounts of data and has shown some impressive footage of their vehicles driving in Israel. Openpilot also has a similar strategy to autonomous driving to Tesla. With all the different approaches having their own strengths and weaknesses it\'s hard to pinpoint a leader, and it seems to me that even if Tesla does ""win"" they wouldn\'t have the space to themselves for long. On top of this taxi services are renowned for being low yield investments based on historical data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe insurance of car will earn billions because the FSD (full self driving and autonomous driving) will reduce the car accidents by 99% in several years\n\nSee above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla is going to be the electricity grid company, and it will give them another huge area, and in this area too, they will dominate because of their ability to innovate\n\nWhy should we believe that Tesla will dominate the energy industry? In terms of physical battery production Panasonic, CATL, LG Chem and others already have larger manufacturing capabilities and in fact supply the majority of Tesla\'s batteries. In terms of solar Solarcity was only worth a couple of billion when Tesla purchased them and their performance since has been poor. There are also many other much larger players in this space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- They will sell as many cars as they produce, because they can reduce prices, they earn 25% on each car, and they reduce constantly the production costs\n\nTrue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The capacity will grow from 500K now to 2 million cars per year by 2022 (adding Austin and Berlin, enhancing Shanghai, others may be added, India talks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrue.\n\n\\- They do not waste money on ads and on dealers, these expenses will go to the customers and the stock owners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been true so far but there\'s no guarantee that it will remain the case. It is a common feature that relatively small innovative enthusiast brands don\'t have to spend money on advertising in their early days, but this often changes as they grow. Oneplus would be a good example of this. It\'s also worth noting that up until now the electric car market has been pretty empty, and so it was easy for tesla to stand out just by virtue of having pretty much the only high quality option in any given segment. for instance if you wanted a high performance mid sized electric sedan in Europe or the US, before this year your options were basically Tesla or Tesla. The market is inevitably going to become far more crowded going forward so this advantage will become much more diluted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- They do the vertical integration will reduces the expenses dramatically\n\nBroadly true. I do like their vertical integration and am a fan of this approach generally, but it is not without downsides, for example requiring large upfront capital investment which can drag a company down and make it harder to change course.\n\n\\- They are innovators, they figure out how to do the car innovations (more than 100 significant innovations) that make cars better in any parameter, while other companies succeed to copy only 10% of what Tesla does\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey\'re an extremely innovative company, sure. The rest of this comment is pure bullshit  though.  Their cars are better in ANY parameter, you seriously believe that crap? Just off the top of my head I can think of many objective and measurable ""parameters"" in which other vehicles outperform anything in Tesla\'s current line up. For example the Bolt has a better price/miles of range ratio,  Porsche Taycan has beaten the model S at the standing quarter on various independent tests, including Top Gear and Carwow, as well as having a better Nurburgring time. Many vehicles score better on reliability statistics, Rolls Royce have better sound insulation, many diesel cars have better range, many cars have higher quality interiors (ok that one is subjective but basically undisputed), i could go on. Don\'t get me wrong Teslas are great cars but it\'s completely disingenuous to imply that they blow all other cars out the water on all measures.\n\n\\- They have a huge technical advantage over other car companies and this advantage is only growing\n\nThis may be true but this statement is to vague to really comment on as you haven\'t specified any of these advantages.\n\n\\- Tesla users are fans because they understand how amazing their products are, similarly to Apple, the biggest company in the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat point and I completely agree. Only caveat is that this is also a feature of enthusiast brands and liable to dissipate over time like I mentioned previously.\n\n\\- Tesla has a huge advantage on their own battery cells, and it is patented, it will be 50% times cheaper and 50% higher capacity, will last 5 times longer, just amazing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n50% cheaper etc etc compared to what??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Tesla creates batteries at the level that no other company does (even when using the battery cells that others can use)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain pretty vague.

Most people I've spoken to believe it requires mathematical knowledge, programming skills, hours of research, and so on.

Fundamentals are still solid, that FCF is ridiculous and solid in the economical shift we have seen. I think you kind of have to step away from these echo chambers, as they will be pushed to justify other competitors' evaluations and look at the numbers a bit more. For example, right now the big thing is that Intel is feeling pressure from AMD on the datacenter. However, if you actually look at AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Custom (where they report server sales) that shift is not showing. That segment has had flat sales quarter after quarter and year or year. Now that can change as Q3 earnings are coming up and that is a number I will be paying attention to. This is different from their Computing and Graphics division which is the one that is growing. So just strong sentiment around Intel at the moment as people will pick and dissect any report. The critic is valid but somewhat ridiculous give the evaluation the market is giving actually crappy business in other sectors. Wall Street doesn't care about FCF atm, they want to see growth doesn't matter if it even translates to the bottom line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said Intel fundamentals are solid imo and they got a decent buffer to get back on track to get sentiment back on their side. Stuff does get delayed all the time with them. Like someone else one else said of the stronger bull cases in Intel can make a killer product to turn it around. They have stuff in the works and spend loads on R&amp;D. Intel isn't focused on keeping the consumer high-end desktop market like Wall Street thinks it is and extrapolating AMD's win there to evaluate all of Intel on. That is a declining market and a win there won't even move the needle for them as much as the effort would take to beat AMD there. Intel is more focused on things that will really move the needle for them. As long as they keep notebook sales going up and their market share in the server space they are fine giving the desktop market to AMD (just look at AMD's gross margins). There are several different barriers AMD has to break to really win in the datacenter. Nvidia is the big threat here as they are moving into more datacenter stuff and with ARM they would probably move more in the CPUs in multiple applications that Intel has a stronghold on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPromising things I see in Intel that if executed correctly can change sentiment:\n\n\\- Saphire Lake Server CPU with CXL should change datacenter stuff a lot\n\n\\- MobileEye (duh)\n\n\\- Optane (3D Xpoint). Think this will needed more as datacenter storage needs will evolve.\n\n\\- Alder Lake and their hybrid CPUs. How these do will point to if they can really keep up with ARM and different CPU workloads.\n\n\\- Habana Labs AI training chips. This is one of Nvidia's biggest bull cases and this is Intel's second attempt at this. I am keeping a close eye on this one as AI training will be a big market. I think Intel's engineering knowledge could bring some decent gain to that market to allow them to get a piece of that pie.\n\n\\- Discrete GPUs. The money really isn't at the consumer level it is at the datacenter level. Nvidia has a huge lead in the data center GPUs here and it is their cash cow based on AI training. Intel also trying this will help it in a lot of other efforts.\n\n\\- And a lot of other stuff. Intel is in a lot. They are spreading their bets among a lot of stuff and with their cash flow + talent they can do that.\n\nIntel has some buffer here on missteps on execution to turn the ship around to find something to grow and get multiple expansion going. They kind of need to be head down for a while. Everyone is like is Intel going to be an IBM or will be a MSFT with the Nadella pivot. I am leaning more to the MSFT theory. It is definitely not a short-term play tho as it will take time for stuff to pan out and then Wall Street's sentiment to change. \n\nI have a position :P"", ""you are, you keep referencing whining. so youve made it relevant\n\nThe brooke decision is old, my point is it only looks at the consumer from an old era.

The app, which has a 4.9 rating in **Apple**\'s App Store, uses advanced algorithms and automation to enable people ""to apply for a mortgage, interact with our team members, upload documents, e-sign documents, receive statements, and complete monthly payments."" The platform\'s technology also has a texting feature so people can speak directly with lenders at the company.\n\nRocket has also developed other digital solutions. Amrock, a complementary platform to Rocket Mortgage, provides title insurance services, property valuations, and settlement services through digital appraisal and closing services.\n\n## 2. Results to back it up\n\nRocket argues that its technology has led to the company\'s huge success in capturing more than 9% of the $2 trillion annual mortgage market. It also says the technology helps its team and clients close loans quicker than the rest of the industry.\n\nIn 2019, Rocket said that on average it completed 6.7 loans per month per team member, compared to the industry average of 2.3, citing data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This year, Rocket claims this number has now grown to 8.3 loans per month. Most loans originated at Rocket close in 32 days or fewer from when the company receives mortgage documents from a client, a number that beats the 43-day industry average, the company claims.\n\n## 3. A large tech team\n\nRocket employs a 2,500-person technology team that focuses on advanced algorithms, analytics and automation, and technology that can be integrated by partners outside the company. The company said it also has developed special tech teams to come up with new ideas and make the mortgage process more efficient. Rocket\'s Quicken Loans recently enjoyed a five-year stretch as\xa0*Computerworld* magazine\'s ""Best Place to Work in IT"" among companies with 5,000-plus employees.\n\n## 4. Leveraging data\n\nAlgorithms are powered by data, and Rocket has loads of it. In 2019, the company had communications with more than 20 million potential clients. Using its technology and marketing specializations, the company said it has improved its conversion of client leads to closed loans, enabling Rocket to grow home loans without increasing client leads at the same rate. Rocket also does mortgage servicing for more than 1.8 million homeowners, and has access to 220 million unique consumer records and 150 million unique real estate records.\n\n""Our technology and data science teams are proficient in leveraging this rich data to streamline the client experience, to improve the efficacy of our marketing campaigns, and to offer products and services suited to each client\'s specific circumstance,"" Rocket said in its prospectus.\n\n## 5. Applying tech in other loan segments\n\nWhile home loans are by far its biggest product, Rocket has also created technology platforms for other promising loan segments. Rocket Loans, the company\'s personal loan platform, uses analytics and algorithms to approve borrowers quickly, and plans to license the platform to other vendors. Rocket Homes, a website that helps potential borrowers search for homes and connect with real estate agents, received more than 180,000 unique visits per month in 2019, and ""is poised to disrupt the U.S. real estate point of sale market.""\n\n## 6.

This isn't even considering the existing knowledge base of systems admins used to working on a defined mix of components but you get the idea...These segments are the main cash cow for Intel's business and this won't be shrinking for decades to come. \n\nThe consumer and prosumer segment is frankly not that important from an earnings perspective but it's the one that most of us know about in any great detail(Thanks LTT).

[High-quality advisors](https://itexus.com/robo-advisor-in-wealth-management-benefits-features-to-develop/) provide data-driven analysis and predictions. The most prominent pros for me are:\n\n### 1. Addressing changing needs\n\nIt is much more simple for a customer to get started with an automated investment advisor: he/she answers questions about his/her financial goals, income, and risk tolerance. The algorithms inherent in the robo-advisor’s mechanism create a personalized asset allocation model, and pick out different securities to diversify a client’s portfolio and decrease its volatility. Users don’t need to monitor the market themselves and figure out where to invest their money. On top of that, robo-advisors are available 24/7 on any computer, from any device.\n\n### 2. Targeting new client segments\n\nFirst, robo-advisors are a low-cost alternative to traditional wealth managers. As stated by [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission-broker.asp), human financial planners generally charge a 1-2% rate with the potential to add on a commission-based fee or apply their hourly or daily rates for consultation services. Robo-advisors charge a much lower fee or even provide services which are free of charge.\xa0\n\nSecond, robo-advisors attract customers with lower investment amounts. Some digital advisors, like Wealthsimple, have no account minimum at all: a user can get started with as little as $1.\xa0\n\nThird, robo-advisors are an effective tool for private investors with profound knowledge of investments and the financial market trends. They allow investors to manage their accounts, pick and choose investment without the need to interact with an advisor.\xa0\n\n### 3. Automation of financial advisory processes\n\nA robo investing advisor fulfils time-consuming, yet simple tasks: it collects data, assigns portfolios, and adjusts them for changes in market forces or client profiles. This way, wealth management companies can optimize their back office processes, save their financial and human resources, and increase their own capacity and productivity, focusing on more complicated tasks.\xa0"", 'AMC, CCL, FB, GME, NKLA, ACB, Foxconn', 'Thanks for pointing that out.

I wouldn't invest in oil, TSLA, or frankly good tech stocks at the current ridiculous price points. \n\nHere's my perspective on oil:  \n   \nFirst off covid ain't over, from the get go many epidemiologists said fall and winter could b e brutal and we are currently seeing case spikes around the developed world which are leading to new lockdowns which will affect demand for oil short term.\n\nOver the next few years, honestly I have no idea. Oil may or may not get back to the prices you're expecting. \n\nChange can happen incredibly quickly and as a society we have been enduring covid for long enough to permanently change habits. How much will actually change once we get out of the pandemic? That's the billion dollar question. I think eventually air travel will come back and I bought airbus this summer with plans to hold it for at least 10 years. \n\nOnce covid is over, now what for oil?  \n\nBP said straight out that we may be at peak oil demand.

Maybe it's that the electric segment of auto sales is the only one showing growth? \n\nMost oil is used for ground transportation. \n\nSmall changes in demand for a commodity can have a huge effect on prices as suppliers compete to sell to a smaller group of consumers. \n\nSo you're betting that RDS and BP are in better positions than other oil majors as they start to compete in an era of stagnant or reducing demand for oil.\n\nBut that's not all your betting on. You bought BP and RDS not XOM or CVX. BP and RDS have made real commitments to switch to green energy and are actually putting their money where their mouths are in a way that the American oil companies just aren't. That's money that they aren't using for dividends or oil investments.

He spoke after bigwigs including Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, and Yi Gang, the central bank governor.\n\n&gt; “Our next speaker needs little introduction,” the host said. “He says he came to the Bund Summit today to throw a bomb.”...\n\n&gt; He then proceeded to throw several bombs. He roasted financial regulators for being obsessed with minimizing risk, even though, he said, “there is no innovation in this world without risk.” He accused China’s banks of behaving like “pawnshops” by lending only to those who could put up collateral.\n\nPeople in China don\'t doubt that he intended to attack the regulation of fintech. Or that he acted like an ass:\n\n&gt; One wag on social media called Mr. Ma’s remarks in Shanghai “the most expensive speech in history.”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/technology/china-ant-group-ipo.html\n\nBut I think the thing to recognize here, that makes all the difference in my assessment, is that China\'s fintech empires were making money hand over fist in an an area of finance in China that was being largely ignored, and there wasn\'t a lot of control over how much money was being lent in loans that were backed with nothing and being resold as securities. When the value of those businesses start amounting to trillions, as the ANT IPO demonstrated, that\'s a big systemic risk to society. So not a lot of people are arguing that regulation was uncalled-for or unnecessary.\n\nJack Ma blew up the IPO because he was trying to lead an insurrection against regulation that would limit the value of ANT, but that was needed, and the way he chose to defy authority speaks to his own inability to compromise or work within a system of financially responsible constraints.  I also wonder what the businesses are doing if he has so much problem with oversight and regulation. \n\nThis disaster says more about Jack Ma\'s lack of judgment and defiant egotism than the CCP. I don\'t trust his personal judgment anymore and while I think that BABA is a great business and has a great future, I don\'t think that it has as much potential as I thought last week. To me, I need to see how much the company is worth after the halo of ""exceptionalism in leadership"" factor fades and Americans realize what an intemperate jerk he is, before I\'ll allocate more than a few percent to BABA and its related businesses again. \n\nJack Ma threw a temper tantrum to try to leverage his fame and epic IPO to escape regulation instead of working responsibly with the government on regulation that is overdue for China\'s fintech businesses. He fucked over everyone who had invested money and time into this IPO and I lost money along with a lot of other people. I don\'t forgive him.']"

At the time, the stock price was just over $50 a share. Now, the price is around $80 a share. There are good reasons for that: On a\xa0GAAP\xa0basis, revenue for the second quarter of this year was up 38% year over year, operating margin was 39%, and earnings per share increased an astounding 74% year over year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $768 million, and looking back over the past 12 months, the company generated $2.14 billion in operating cash flow. That's pretty good.\nUser engagement is strong. The company had 428 million monthly active users in the third quarter, with 125 million for the Activision segment and 32 million for the Blizzard segment. The other 271 million? Those folks were all playing games produced by King, the social and mobile publisher Activision acquired back in 2016.

Many people are stuck at home, with some forms of leisure and entertainment unavailable for the time being. Video gaming is something that\xa0is\xa0available. Plus, many of Activision Blizzard's franchises offer social engagement to players who can't get it elsewhere. If you can't meet up with your friends at a bar or restaurant, you can jump online with them and run through a\xa0Call of Duty: Warzone\xa0mission or match up against them in\xa0Overwatch.\nThe pandemic won't last forever. We expect, however, that Activision Blizzard will build on its impressive COVID-19-fueled performance from this year and continue to grow its business and reward shareholders. The positive trends in the video game industry aren't going away, and Activision is well positioned to thrive.

[Link to the interview here.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/dan-gilbert-acquisitions-may-be-ahead-for-rocket-companies.html)\n\nGilbert is right in saying that mortgages are probably the hardest thing to do electronically. Online banking, retirement accounts, traditional brokerages are all very easy compared to mortgages since there are different lending practices in each state.\n\nWhen the dust settles from COVID I could see RKT making a move on one of the online-only banks. Ally and Chime come to mind. Ally's market cap is like 10B and Chime was being valued at 5-7 B when they were talking about an IPO (Ally's pretty big, Chime might be okay size). I think those would be good matches because Rocket is such a leader in the Mortgage lending segment. To get a full banking arm, they'd not only gain more mortgages, but the people who have their mortgage with them might also switch to make their payments easier.\n\nThe other direction they could go in modern, buying up a robo-advisor like wealthfront or betterment.

However, that does mean that PLTR is **cash flow positive**. They're not actually burning money in their bank account like the media implies. That said, it's not the greatest that PLTR is handing out stock based comp like candy.\n\nA lot of tech companies are unprofitable now.

In terms of risk/benefit ratio, many want to get in while it's still unprofitable before everyone, their mother, and their dog gets in when they start making money. PLTR also provided guidance on this upcoming Q with 290M in revenues (up almost 50% YoY) and a 62M non-GAAP profit. From what I remember though, their stock based comp projection was huge so they're most likely going to unprofitable again in GAAP EPS. If you factor in their fairly new commercial sector that they're scaling, it looks like investors are betting on this segment to grow exponentially.

Coke is the most staple dividend stock out there, and it only returns a dividend that's 5% of its stock price (5% dividend yield). The S&amp;P500 historically has returned 9% on average. The dividends have less volatility since it's a consistent 5% meanwhile the S&amp;P500 could have 5 years where the annual return is -1%, 3%, 30%, 15%, -2% (comes out to 9% on average over 5 year time span). But if you're just buying and holding then it makes sense just to buy the S&amp;P500.\n\nThe risk with dividends is that during tough times the first thing a company will cut to save money is the dividend. Typically the stock price falls along with the dividend. So if Coke were to suddenly crumble (let's say news/studies came out suggesting Coke causes cancer) and people stopped buying Coke then not only does the 5% dividend go away, but the stock price will probably fall 20+%.\n\nThere are instances where a company has financially plateu'd or been in a minor decline, but they have not slashed their dividend because they know investors will jump ship the moment their dividend is slashed. So a stock price drop but a maintained dividend causes the dividend yield to shoot up which makes it really attractive...the issue is that assuming the stock price drop is well deserved and not an overreaction by the market. If the company's financials continue to crumble then the dividends will be getting slashed eventually. Gamestop and General electric the past several years are great examples of why investing just for a company's dividend is not a good strategy.\n\nThe trick to beating the market is to not focus on dividends, but instead focus on how a company's net income growth % annually is performing relative to changes in the stock price. If a company's net income growth yearly is 20% on average...and the stock price is only growing 5% on average then you will probably make more money investing there because the stock price will eventually catch up and grow at a 20% rate as well (15% net gain which beats out a 5% dividend). Apple and Lam Research in late 2018, and CVS this past year are great examples of great buying opportunities where the stock price was way lower relative to the company's net income growth %, and eventually the stock prices shot up to reflect the financial growth."", ""Lots of upside for a middle-price-tier product.

2020-11-16,"['Another reddit pump. DKNG, GME, NIO, now PLTR. Ride the wave and get out before the fall', 'Yes, the link had some. I didn’t say that no company did the same. But you explicitly stated that pltr would compete with Facebook or Apple, which they - as you should have noticed by now - clearly don’t do.\n\nWhy I chose Pltr over other data companies, very briefly:\n\nI think palantir have understood that humans and AI have to be complementary. Also, they have been developing their software for 17 years and have tested it in various environments - starting with the early PayPal days, then governments and companies. Of course the prominence of peter thiel adds to the positive hype - I don’t think he fucks up a lot. Reading his short book „zero to one“ outlines pretty clearly what business path he envisions for palantir to be successful - build a monopoly in a small market and then scale out of that. Additionally, palantirs numbers are not as bad as of many other ipo companies. They have a good growth rate, have clearly identified the problems they need to solve for profitability, and are working on them. You can see that their numbers have improved a lot in q3 - I am talking gross margin, customer fragmentation, revenue, implementation cost, to name a few.\n\nI also found some user reports in news articles or other web sources, and all of them said the software was tremendous to get work done. \n\nAll put together, pltr seems like a safe bet to me.', 'Almost back to unchanged for the year despite parks and studio not really seeing a recovery until Spring at earliest. It\'s kind of what I said this morning, a lot of quality ""impacted"" names have already bounced a lot.

I’m up 3% on my investments today thanks to Boeing', 'Did you get those GME shares? 14% increase up to now', "" Think of it like this; if you buy and sell anything without discrimination and just buy then sell for what you are offered, the longer you hold it, the more likely it is to increase in value. Without getting into the math I will just say that inflation is real and what you could buy 20 years ago was cheaper and would thus be considered to cost more today. \n\nI think you are trying to reconcile all the noise you see when researching investing and trading. I think you may have been trying to express the question of, day trading, vs swing trading, vs annual balancing, vs long term investing. \n\nI am going to over simply but each approach has different goals and disciplines. \n\nDay trading would not exist if the approach was buy and sell the open and close regardless of price. A successful day trader needs to have rules and the discipline to follow them. This strategy is about bankroll management and is looking to generate income through successful trades. You don't use day trading to build wealth but to generate income. Think of it like a realtor, they make money from helping buy and sell homes. Very few actually invest in homes. \n\nTo continue the real estate analogy, swing trading is like the fix and flip guy in real estate. Buy a home you think is cheap and try to sell it quick at a profit. Swing trading is usually based on news, or earnings, or major market events. You are trying to take advantage of short term moves and again the overall goal would be income, generally not wealth building. \n\nThe next segment is the annual rebalancing. This is not a stand alone method, rather it works in tandem with long term investing. If you own a portfolio of investment properties you are likely trying to evaluate what ones are worth your time and which are not. So you might sell 1 or a few and look for other opportunities that will be less of a headache or more profitable to you. This is a part of wealth building and can have an impact on your income but is for the most part passive. \n\nFinally the buy and hold this level should be more focused on wealth building and as the portfolio mature start focusing on income. You would hope your purchases were well researched and had growth opportunities along the way. This is the real goal of a real estate investor too. They want to own multiple properties that have both equity value and generate income. They want to be in a position to hold the investment and maybe have inheritances to give out. \n\nEach level has a different possible value and comes with their own risks and rewards. I hope this helps you or anyone. \n\nIf you want to dig into this more I do stream about investing in the stock market on twitch."", 'Same.

2020-11-20,"['Are you looking to trade, or *invest*?\n\nIt’s fine to go either route -- mind you, I’d highly encourage the latter -- but you have to approach it with consistency.\n\nIf you’re looking to day or swing trade, you’re dealing in terms of hours or days, and you’re likely looking for volatility. Otherwise, you should be thinking in terms of *years*.\n\nWhen thinking long-term, even a single year is too short — try more like *5*. I know it’s challenging, but remember that patience is the name of the game.\n\nAgain, if you want to think in shorter terms, that’s fine, but there are likely better securities for that approach.\n\nLet\'s look at some of the picks you mentioned.\n\n&gt;BABA\n\nLet me guess: You probably consider them to be the Amazon of China?\n\nWell, so do I -- and you\'re going to miss out if you think that\'s going to happen overnight, or even next week. You\'ve decided to keep a hold of them, and I think that\'s a wise decision.\n\n&gt;nio\n\nProbably because you see them as potentially being the Tesla of China?\n\nI agree on this as well. The same advice as above applies.\n\n&gt;ETF\n\nI\'d say a good rule of thumb for most any ETF is to hold for the long term. ETFs are a bet on an industry or a segment, not a single security.\n\n&gt;barrick gold corp  \n&gt;  \n&gt;stick with it now that more and more lock downs are initiated.\n\nYou decided to go with Barrick because you feel that lockdowns will increase, and this will increase its value.\n\nYou have one question to ask yourself: Do you think that\'s a sound strategy?\n\nIf the answer is ""yes,"" then *stick with it*.\n\nIt\'s normal and to be expected that you will not be 100% certain. If we could predict the future and the results of our decisions, we would all be Warren Buffet. But you are either making a decision based on your best guess of what will happen and the results of these events, or you are gambling. Which is it?\n\nIf it\'s the former, then stick with it. If the securities dip, buy it -- responsibly. If you\'re treating the markets like Vegas, then you need to seriously consider the risk at play.\n\nRemember the following rules of thumb:\n\n* You only realize a loss if you sell in the red.\n* No one ever went broke taking profits.\n\nIf you are making a good faith guess in your strategy, there is no reason to sell in the red. Doing so means that you are not willing to see it pan out.\n\nIf your strategy pays off, it\'s okay to take profits. If you feel that staying invested in a security runs the risk of losing what you\'ve gained, then pull out.\n\nAnd don\'t forget that you don\'t have to sell out of your entire position. If you have a good day and want to capitalize on it but feel there is more to be had, then sell a portion of your holdings.\n\nI\'d highly recommend approaching the markets with a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. Put a consistent amount of money over time into securities you have faith in, and when taking profits, do so in limited amounts.\n\nI\'d also recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xexqXNxQ5fU). Jeremy definitely has some click-baity video titles, but this is excellent advice for a young investor.\n\nFinally, spend all this energy you have around the price of your securities on researching new opportunities. Close the app. Don\'t look at the charts. Spend your time and attention on learning more about the companies you are invested in and their future, and on finding new opportunities that excite you.\n\nHopefully this helps!', 'I agree!

Tesla has first mover advantage but there are tons of other players in the EV market that make equally competitive or even better cars.

It feels at times like this sub is more fixated on what to be concerned about in regards to the market than what areas might be promising. \n\n""Feels really weird that in this time when big segments of the economy are being hit really hard, the market is rising like mad.""\n\nI wish people would look at earnings, read conference calls and see what companies are saying. Yes, there are some sectors that have been impacted. There are also sectors that are doing great and telling you that years of growth/adoption have been pulled forward. Even some of the companies in impacted sectors if you actually look at what they are saying are saying that things are at least a bit better than they\'d expected. \n\nAre there some sectors (EVs) and various meme stocks that within the last month or so seem to be in ""buy at any price"" mode? Yes. Congrats to those who own those names, but keep in mind that even though you may think a theme is a great long-term theme, things can get way ahead of themselves in the short-term and take some profits when you have something that has doubled or more in a very short period of time and has an RSI of 90+. I bought SBE thinking that it was going to be a comfortable long-term play on EV infrastructure, but it got to the point - and I said as much the other day - where it had gotten so silly that I was selling into it.  EV SPACs that have yet to produce a vehicle or that produce vehicles that look like EV golf carts (FUV) doubling or tripling in a few weeks on no news is well into absurdity.\n\nThings like the EV run can go on longer than many think, but I do think that when you have a sector where you start thinking ""this is too easy"" and you could do well in just about any name, even the lower quality ones - it\'s time to be concerned. Pot stocks felt that way a couple of years ago, too. Even if the EV party cools off, I don\'t think that\'s going to have broader implications, similar to how various other sector/theme bubbles over the last decade (3D printing, pot stocks, rare earths, etc) haven\'t either. \n\nI think as things hopefully gradually move towards normalcy next year, the question becomes how much lasting damage is there going to be to impacted sectors of the economy and how much of the growth themes that had a huge tailwind from this will be sustained. I think in terms of the latter, when you look at something like Zoom, you will see I think a lot of the casual use cool off but businesses will certainly not go back to pre-covid levels of virtual meeting use as many non-essential meetings that used to require travel will be done over Zoom. I think a lot of what e-commerce gained during this will stick. In terms of impacted, I think there will be a lot of leisure travel, but business travel remains a question. How much extra will travelers have to go through to get on an airplane.  Will you have to have taken a vaccine to get into a concert? (https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan/)\n\nWhile I wouldn\'t complain, I don\'t think that growth stocks are going to see a repeat of this year but I think this year did give a very significant boost to long-term themes.  I think that impacted names will gradually recover, but when you look at what\'s still well off highs, it\'s not that compelling. A lot of quality impacted names (DIS, BFAM, SBUX, CHDN, etc etc) have bounced considerably and in some cases are already back to new all time highs/near all time highs even though they\'re a ways off from returning to normal.\n\n""Feels really weird that in this time when big segments of the economy are being hit really hard, the market is rising like mad.""\n\nThis unfortunately has been a very difficult time for small businesses, particularly in things like retail and restaurants. If the independent store had to close or be very restricted during this or had to take on additional costs, that\'s hugely difficult for a lot of small businesses. Walmart and Target stayed open and can handle those costs. Target also has multiple different options for orders - Shipt, pick up in store, drive-up pick up, shipping, buy in store. Most independent stores don\'t, although Shopify/Square are starting to offer buy online/pick up in store solutions. \n\nSo the big chains win and gain more share, the small chains lose and what independents don\'t lose are in many cases running to Wix/Shopify/etc to evolve so Shopify, etc win.\n\nDominos, Chipotle and others have discussed ""real estate opportunities"" (read: the independent restaurant a great location for a decade had to close so now we get an opportunity at a great location that would previously have been unavailable.) Ultimately, the big get bigger and that\'s unfortunate.\n\nMany tech companies have discussed even impacted sectors spending on digital transformation because they have to to keep up. \n\nThere\'s been so many ""BUT WHY IS THE MARKET GOING UP!?!?!?"" posts this year. If you just look around, it\'s clear that while portions of the economy are unfortunately impacted, others are fine or considerably benefiting. \n\n""Lots of analysts seem to believe we\'re in the midst of a stock market bubble, quite probably a very large one""\n\nI\'m not sure that *that* many do, but this sub is fixated on things like that so some calling bubble becomes a Very Big Focus, because really - when you think about a lot of the articles that have gotten posted on here over time it\'s some variation on ""someone said something negative, DAE think bubble/recession/bear market/financial crisis? should I sell?""', 'The other problem with Tesla is that it relies heavily on the Elon cult, and that could be problematic considering how erratic his behavior can be.

They may have a superior software platform compared to competition but that doesn't mean they are selling software to others, which is be far more lucrative than their core business of mortgages. Geographically speaking I'm not sure what their growth prospects are like- it seems they are pretty decently expanded across the US and Canada and there probably aren't too many opportunities for growth.  We are also in one of the hottest mortgage environments in a decade because interest rates have been lowered and the TTM amount of business is crazy due to the amount of refi's that are happening.\n\nAnother big issue is they also do not pay any dividends to shareholders- most financial companies do and relatively high yields at that (2-5% normally).  Looking at a stock like RKT compared to JPM- it pays a healthy dividend and has a history of increasing that dividend over time (A+ thing to look for from an investor perspective).  Analysts anticipate modest growth over the next 5 years (gets a checkmark in my book- they will be able to keep increasing their dividend it looks like).  \n\nAnother issue I see is that RKT is a niche company and a pure play- they are not a diversified financial services firm, which means there is a higher amount of risk associated with a competitor or newer, better product displacing them.  They may be the hot thing for now in mortgages, but what about in 10, 20, 30 years?  Financial services firms that are diversified, have multiple business segments (wealth management, M&amp;A, trading, consumer banking, investment banking, etc.) in my opinion, are much safer plays.  When I think about those types of companies JPM, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley all come to mind.  \n\nThere are two reasons that I think why companies go public- one is because they actually need to raise capital to scale operations, scale the business, and make more money.  The other, imo, is to let the current shareholders cash out and lock in a ton of profit.  So here we have a company that is relatively mature, has been around for a while, and doesn't seem to have a ton of growth potential geographically- so why did they need to go public?

Fuck that piGz dude on Webull by the way', ""Here's the relevant bits for people who dont want to look for it in the whole document.   \n\n\nTL;DR - nothing nefarious here. Its just most states were so overwhelmed they weren't able to process claims each week, thus several weeks worth of claims were bundled into one week when a person's claims were finally recorded. The initial unemployment claims data we get each week are still good. The analysis here is focused on continuing claims and how the number of continuing claims was usually higher than expected if you add up the cumulative number of initial claims. Also most of these issues were within the PUA program. There is little to no discussion in the text about regular UI or PEUC.  \n\n\n&gt; DOL’s weekly UI news releases include valuable state-reported data on claims volume, but they have improperly represented the number of unique individuals claiming UI benefits and the changes in these numbers from week to week. Each week, DOL publishes the number of continued claims submitted by states in all UI programs (i.e., weeks of unemployment claimed by individuals during a reporting period), and reports it as the total number of people claiming benefits in all programs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While DOL officials told us that they have traditionally used the number of continued claims to represent the number of individuals claiming benefits because they were a close approximation of each other, various issues arising from the pandemic have made this practice problematic—potentially overstating the number of individuals in certain circumstances and understating the number in others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prior to the pandemic, according to DOL officials, the number of continued claims approximated the number of people claiming benefits because each week individuals typically filed a claim for just the previous one week of continued unemployment.[\\[349\\]](https://www.gao.gov/reports/GAO-21-191/#fnref349) However, this has not been the case during the pandemic because of challenges implementing the newly created PUA program and backlogs in processing historic numbers of claims in many states. For example, for the week ending October 24, 2020, states reported about 21.2 million continued claims in all programs—about 6.8 million in the regular UI program, about 9.4 million in the PUA program, and about 4.9 million in other programs, such as the PEUC program.[\\[350\\]](https://www.gao.gov/reports/GAO-21-191/#fnref350) However, the number of continued claims is not equivalent to the number of individuals claiming benefits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If an individual claims benefits for multiple weeks of unemployment during a single reporting period, each week is counted as a separate continued claim. This could happen if an individual was unemployed for multiple weeks before their application was processed—due to claims backlogs—or if the individual claimed benefits retroactively in the PUA program.[\\[351\\]](https://www.gao.gov/reports/GAO-21-191/#fnref351) **Thus, by using claims counts to represent the number of people, individuals who submitted multiple claims are counted more than once in DOL’s estimate**, which has been prevalent during the pandemic. For example, according to a news release by the California Employment Development Department, as of September 16, 2020, the state had a backlog of nearly 600,000 individuals who had applied for UI benefits and whose applications had not been processed for more than 21 days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reliability of DOL’s weekly reporting of claims data is also affected by inconsistent state reporting of PUA data, which has resulted in flawed week-to-week comparisons of total claims numbers. From April through October, different numbers of states reported PUA data in many weeks. For example, states started reporting PUA claims data at different times, depending on how quickly they were able to implement the new program and establish reporting processes. In addition, even after implementing the program, in certain weeks some states did not report data to DOL to include in its weekly news releases.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The inconsistency in the group of states reporting each week undermines meaningful comparisons over time and may have led DOL to inaccurately characterize changes in claims numbers in their weekly UI news releases.** For example, in its July 23, 2020, publication, DOL reported that the number of continued claims in all programs for the week ending July 4 decreased by about 200,000 from the previous week. However, Arizona did not report PUA data for that week, after reporting almost 2.3 million claims the previous week. Had Arizona submitted data, DOL likely would have reported a significant increase in claims from the prior week instead of a decrease. Arizona stopped reporting data that week due to suspected fraud in the PUA program, according to DOL officials.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Potential fraud in the UI system, and particularly in the PUA program, according to DOL, further complicates counts, as some states’ claims numbers may be inflated due to fraudulent claims, while others’ numbers may not be. For example, Maine canceled almost 24,000 initial claims and 41,000 continued claims between late May and late June that it determined to be fraudulent, according to a state labor department news release.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Backlogs in states’ claims processing and the ability to claim benefits retroactively have resulted in individuals claiming multiple weeks of benefits in single reporting periods. Multi-week claims are especially prevalent in the PUA program because individuals accumulated weeks of unemployment as states implemented the new program. PUA continued claims make up a large part of DOL’s reported total number of people claiming benefits. However, analyzing data for 20 selected states, we found that the number of continued claims submitted in the PUA program through June 27, 2020, exceeded by almost 20 million the cumulative number of individuals who had submitted an initial claim since the program began   \n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, in California—where claimants generally certify for 2 weeks of benefits at a time—analysis by the California Policy Lab suggests that the number of continued claims in the state consistently exceeded twice the number of individuals submitting those claims. For example, during the week ending August 8, 2020, the California Policy Lab found that about 2.2 million individuals submitted about 6.3 million continued claims—almost 2 million greater than the 4.4 million that might be expected based on the number of claimants.[\\[353\\]](https://www.gao.gov/reports/GAO-21-191/#fnref353) **The excess claims likely reflect retroactive weeks claimed and demonstrate how counts of continued claims can cause over-reporting of the number of individuals claiming benefits. In this case, most of this over-reporting occurred in the PUA program. According to the California Policy Lab, PUA claimants, on average, filed claims for about 4 to 9 weeks of unemployment each week from early May through late August. Over the same period, regular UI claimants, on average, filed for slightly more than 2 weeks of benefits each week**.[\\[354\\]](https://www.gao.gov/reports/GAO-21-191/#fnref354)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To understand the supportive role UI and PUA benefits are playing in the economy during the pandemic, reliable data are needed on both the number of new claimants each week and the number of continuing claimants who are relying on program benefits. Federal standards for internal control state that management should process data into quality information that is complete, accurate, and readily available to the intended audience when needed. DOL has continued to collect and report claims data in the ways it has historically, which provides some valuable information about the volume of claims submitted. However, because of the atypical unemployment environment during the pandemic, the use of these traditional methods has resulted in the inaccurate reporting of information about the number of individuals receiving benefits. States already collect information to identify and pay unique individuals claiming UI benefits, and could use this information to provide DOL with an accurate weekly count of individuals submitting initial and continued claims, along with the number of claims submitted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Without an accurate accounting of the number of individuals who are relying on UI and PUA benefits in as close to real-time as possible, policy makers may be challenged to respond to the crisis at hand. In addition, with the looming expiration of the PUA program in December 2020, policy makers may need better information about how many individuals face a loss of benefits and what segments of the population and the economy may be most affected."", 'ok so u admit than that no one actually buys at gamestop, people order online.', 'Well personally I only dumped out for a few weeks to harness this gme short squeeze, once it pops ill be putting it all back in nio/Sears I think.\n\nNio is a great company.', 'Again zero arguments\n\nPlease again explain why u first went to gme, then to best buy and then back to gme if its such a good shop and u clearly are so good at not wasting ur time', 'How the system for the text detection is every single character has to match their list of banned words for example: ""love"" might be banned but ""l0ve"" might not.

If GME is a viable option though this might just be my first move.', 'PLTR, GME and CRSR. All three looking pretty good.', 'GME for sure. At least a good short term gain', 'Do you want throw in and forget kind of companies? Those are easy to find and you’ll get many recommendations. High dividend REIT’s, QQQ etc. But lemme tell you bout this stock GME. It’s more mid term than long term, but the potential is there. Everything from console cycle, new management, financials, to short squeeze and new site traffic all point to &lt;$40 within 6 months and its @ 17 rn.', ""Lots of reasons:\n\nThe elephant in the room is it's a cyclical business they get a massive boom in revenue every 7 years with new consoles. This is the beginning of a new cycle. \n\nMajor investors have taken a stake. One of which is an online retail guru with plans of being very active in pivoting gamestop's business model to an omnichannel experience. \n\nStrong cash flow and improving balance sheet, gamestop has been consistently buying back their own stock for a while now with excess cash flow. Last earnings call they were net $0 debt when compared to cash on hand and outstanding short term debt. Most recently they announced  they are going to be paying down 63% of their short term debt early on Dec 11. Another sign of strong cash flow and only improves the balance sheet even more. \n\nRevenue sharing agreements, gamestop now gets lifetime revenue from every xbox it sells thanks to an agreement with Microsoft. Meaning every digital game download they get a cut of the profit. Not perfect but a step in the right direction for an age of digital. Though most gamers claim to prefer physical copies of games still. \n\nMassive short interest. Many institutions bet that this company would be bankrupt right now and I think it's telling that if a nationwide shutdown couldn't kill this company it's stronger than meets the eye. They currently have a share float of 22m and 67m shares are sold short. Never in history has any company been this heavily shorted and could end in a massive squeeze. The gaming industry is massive, gamestop is a $1B market cap. There is a lot to indicate they could be a strong turn around play with all of these tail winds in their favor. \n\nI've been bullish on this company for a while because the numbers didn't add up. Over $6.4B in revenue for a company at the time trading at less than half a billion. People called me crazy for buying it and it's been the best investment in my portfolio, more than tripling and now the holiday season is here and I only see things getting better for this company with the influx of revenue and new activist investors involved."", ""Well, it is a cashflow positive business so bankruptcy isn't a realistic concern at the moment.

He concluded that the month of November alone had more digital sales than 2019's entire Q4. He's projecting quarterly profits of \\~$5/share base case (!!!!!!).\n\nWhat you are concerned about is the digitization and phasing out of companies like gamestop, where games are now able to be bought online and downloaded immediately. That risk appears overblown based on the sales we're seeing and strong preference for consoles that take physical media (the digital-only ones are $100 cheaper and are not very popular).\n\nIt is a fair critique, that these revenues are a one-time boost and that gamestop needs to modernize. But they're gonna have a massive cash runway, brand recognition, and some real innovators involved that can help drive that transition. I am not concerned about bankruptcy anytime soon."", ""Well, it is a cashflow positive business so bankruptcy isn't a realistic concern at the moment.

I expect many kids will be getting device upgrades of some sort this Christmas/winter to enable them to keep in touch with friends. Adults are also likely looking to upgrade or add a new device due to increased expendable cash from less dining/going out. This will be a broad spend increase, from computers to consoles to displays and speakers. \n\nI think gaming/streaming is very influential on the younger generation and that that market segment is just ramping up. CRSR acquisition of Elgato is great in this context. Same with Skuf. I expect more of these in the next 12 months and maybe a partnership or two. \n\nProduct differentiation is not at the tech spec level but the visual level. I would liken this strategy to Apple’s branding. So you need to change how you think about PC building. It’s not PCMR anymore. These kids aren’t trying to play The Witcher in 4K ultra ray traced 240fps HD. They just wanna have fun with their friends online. Graphics, as long as they aren’t N64, are not paramount. \n\nSo this leads me to their headsets. The newer models sporting RGB features are likely going to dominate the pro-streamer scene.

Insurance is also a very safe industry, and while car insurance may become increasingly irrelevant in the coming years as self-driving cars become commonplace, and health insurance comes with significant policy risks, life and disability insurance (Unum’s specialties) don’t face the same headwinds.\n\n2 Shares BRK.B, bought @ $212.01 - Berkshire Hathaway needs no introduction. It might be the best-run company in the world, it gives me exposure to several fantastic businesses, and I consider it very undervalued.\n\n9.073 Shares INTC, bought @ $49.88 - In my opinion, the market significantly overreacted to the 7nm delay. Intel at sub-$50 was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up on. Intel is a market leader with strong economics and earnings power. Buying at an earnings yield of over 10% is phenomenal value.\n\n28 Shares SAMG, bought @ $12.65 - I love this stock. Silvercrest is a small-cap asset management firm with a high dividend, an earnings growth rate in the mid double-digits, tons of net cash, great returns on equity, and free cash flow numbers that are more than double the company’s net earnings. Each of the company’s funds have a long history of outperforming their benchmarks, and I love the management team. Getting this stock at $12.65 was a steal.\n\n11.193 Shares EPD, bought @ $17.56 - Enterprise Products Partners is a midstream MLP that got hammered in March and has mostly stayed under $20 ever since. Good for me. At my cost basis, the distribution yields me over 10% annually. Midstreams also have significant competitive advantages due to high industry entry costs, and EPD is one of the largest and most well-run pipelines out there. It’s conservatively financed, mostly through corporate bonds with low yields thanks to EPD’s solid credit rating, and its earnings come from fee-based long-term contracts, helping it weather industry recessions more effectively. The stock is priced for failure, but as far as I can tell, it isn’t failing.\n\n10 Shares MOMO, bought @ $19.43 - This is the only loser in my portfolio (so far), as I’m down over 30% since purchasing. I still have a lot of faith in the company, however, and this valuation is ridiculous. Momo has a fantastic balance sheet, heavily invested management, blistering historical growth numbers (which have admittedly faltered recently), and solid profits. I don’t understand the market’s valuation. This is not a $14 stock, and a sub-7 P/E is borderline disrespectful. I’m holding, and considering adding to my position.\n\n8.061 Shares WFC, bought @ $25.12 - Wells, for me, is a pure deep value play and a bet on the new management team. I expect the bank to return, more or less, to 2019 levels of earnings by 2022, which would yield a forward P/E on my cost basis of about 5. A money center bank with that valuation? At that price I don’t even care about the scandals of the last management team. Besides, I love Charlie Scharf.\n\n4 Shares OMC, bought @ $50.66 - I bought into this company about a month ago, and I’m already up almost 30%. In all honesty, that timing was pure luck, but there’s a lot to like about this stock. Advertising is a great business to be in, and OMC is the king of ad agencies. COVID did it’s fair share of damage to the industry (travel &amp; leisure companies are some of the biggest spenders on advertising. Or at least, they were.) but Omnicom is still profitable, more than solvent, it rewards shareholders with a great dividend (over 5% on my cost basis), and it should get back to buying back shares soon enough. Even if it’s a slow-growth company, and even if its earnings took a hit from the pandemic, I like this stock a lot.\n\n8.024 Shares FL, bought @ $31.86 - Foot Locker, to me, exemplifies the term “durable competitive advantage”. There’s a couple of benchmarks I like to use to determine this. Firstly, if the company has sold the same product for the past decade, and is likely to do so for the next decade, it probably has a durable business model. Foot Locker sells shoes. They’ve sold shoes for their entire existence. People will always need shoes. That’s a durable business model. Secondly, to determine brand strength: if you can picture their brand in your head without having to look it up, that’s a strong brand. You know Foot Locker’s brand. You know the employee’s referee-style uniforms, and the logo with the red lettering and a silhouette of one of those referees (another test is to see if you know their slogan or jingle by heart, but that doesn’t apply to FL). Lastly, think about how much it would cost to effectively compete with the company. Foot Locker has a workforce of about 50,000 employees operating over 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores, not to mention a distribution network to support their e-commerce segment. This translates to repeating operating expenses of about $2.5 billion annually, not including what’s sure to have been countless one-time expenses Foot Locker had to deal with while building this empire, or the amount of time it took to build the brand recognition and brand loyalty it possesses. All of this just to eek out profit margins of about 6.5% on average. No start-up will ever be capable of effectively disrupting or competing with a company like that. FL, like all retailers, had its share of struggles due to the pandemic, but has bounced back strongly and crushed analyst estimates in both Q2 and Q3. The big issue is over-reliance on Nike. 70% of FL’s revenue comes from selling Nike products, and a more diversified product line would mean significantly less risk for shareholders. Regardless, NKE and FL have a symbiotic relationship, and unless that changes, I don’t see Nike dropping Foot Locker for a very long time, if ever.\n\n6 Shares QFIN, bought @ $12.42 - 360 digitech is a fast-growing Chinese fintech firm with strong profitability, a solid balance sheet, and an enormous addressable market. The fear surrounding Chinese overregulation and U.S.-China relations pushed this company into a valuation of only about 4.4x earnings at my purchase price. That’s a value proposition I simply can’t turn down, regardless of the (over-exaggerated) risks involved.\n\n4.084 Shares TFC, bought @ $36.49 - Truist, the entity born from the BB&amp;T-SunTrust merger, is a well-managed bank with a strong dividend and decent growth prospects. The bank’s combined operations are liable to be more efficient than their already strong separate operations, and I generally love the prospects of large money-center banks due to the vital services they provide, their strong competitive advantages, and strict federal regulations that make failures and bankruptcies categorically unlikely. An earnings yield of about 10% was a cheap enough valuation for me to take a swing.\n\n3.016 Shares BK, bought @ $35.65 - BK is quite simply a value and dividend play for me. Even in the midst of a wildly disruptive pandemic, earnings have remained extraordinarily stable with margins of 25%. The balance sheet looks great as well, with a $170 billion cash position. Managing to snap it up at a P/E of under 8 with a dividend yield of almost 3.5% was a great bargain for me.\n\nI apologize for writing a damn novel lol, but I thought it might be helpful to others to understand the reasoning behind my decisions. As you can probably tell, this is a very value- and quality-oriented portfolio, which are the traits I believe most portfolios should be centered around. This portfolio also provides an income stream yielding over 3.8% annually on my cost basis. Not bad at all in a 0% interest rate environment.', ""Each time I've seen this GME play described here and elsewhere, there's always the premises that:  \n\n* the shorts supposedly need and expect GME to go to $0.

A lot has been said, (mostly negative) about the acquisition of Solar City, but most people seem to ignore their presence in the storage market. I wonder how many pundits are actually aware of this. The market for energy storage is growing extremely fast. A lot of comments I've seen about this is that the storage market is low margin and hyper competitive. However, this ignores the fact that profitability in this sector is primarily subject to battery pricing. Which brings me to the 800 pound gorilla. sitting quietly in the corner. Elon's battery day announcements. There are still technical hurdles to overcome and for the technology they already have to prove itself. What seemed most important to me was how the projected efficiencies and the affect on pricing was broken down into segments. From that, I think that at least half of the gains are a done deal, and most of the rest *will* work out, though possibly not as quickly as planned. Which means that Tesla is looking at a 20-30% drop in their already low battery prices within about 2 years, and another 20-30% in another 3 years. Note the claims made at battery day, 1/4 the investment cost, and 1/10 the footprint as compared to other battery factories. The expansion of these batteries is constrained only by the availability of raw materials, there was a reason Elon was pleading for nickel mining companies to get in touch. If the raw materials can be found, the projected growth of those battery factories will at least equal all other battery suppliers combined. Without growth in battery supply, EV manufacturers cannot grow. Tesla is the one with the biggest plans for battery supply growth, and the one with the most solid roadmap to achieve those plans.

But Doordash has very limited barrier of entry for competitors. \n  \nThe issues with delivery services like Doordash and Grubhub is;  \n  \n* There is no connection between restaurant (who owns branding of meal), and driver (who is risking tip).

Growth makes everyone richer, so if 30% of drivers turn customers off, that is still a 30% higher valuations for firm.  \n* Restaurants hate what drivers do to their brand.  But due to customer traffic many still use the service.   Many restaurants have very limited visibility into the quality issues in what is delivered.  \n* Doordash bought the best service (Caviar), and assimilated them into Doordash.

Take a look at option chains for meme stocks versus some of the big cap slow movers. These meme stocks typically come with lots of IV. GME versus GE comes to mind. Both are cheap underlying equities, but have very different option pricing. \n\n2. Call/put options are riskier because time is against you (and high implied volatility depending on the time frame). If you look at an option chain, you should notice that December 18 strikes are cheaper than January  15 strikes and significantly cheaper than the 2022 leaps. Prices are more for options with greater time to offset the risk for the option seller. \n\nSo can you only lose a few $100?

Old resistance becomes new support. If you have the capital for it, you can even sell a cash secured put before or after earnings. If you sell before earnings, you capitalize on IV crush and you still have the rest of the week for GME to rise. If you sell the day after, you'd have to time the dip pretty well which might be hard.

When they sell, they usually do it in chunks -- either their entire stake, or half their stake, etc, or to trim their positions (which is negligible). Sellof of half of an institution's stake instantly adds 1-2% of outstanding shares to the current float, increasing the supply with demand constant, thereby reducing the price. On the other hand, WSB, which does not act in concert, cannot move the price unless everyone acts together. This would be the meme power that's been bandied around, except this has to continue day-in day-out to measurably impact the supply and demand. And retail just does not do that.

But there are lots of stocks that fall in this. First off, take a huge deep breath because in the end this is ""all money"". I know money can make life easier but your FOMO is just about how you\'re perceiving your world having changed if you invested in TSLA.\n\nNext, sit down and reflect on the past. Think about how much you would have invested back in April given your mind set. Seriously, think about the realities of the situation. Stock market had crashed, COVID was raging, economic collapse was a real aura in the air. If you look at just the stock price and think about ""if I just yolo\'d my life savings in to TSLA then, I could retire now!"", there are infinite stocks you could have done this with.\n\nAlso, you stated you had a legitimate reason not to buy TSLA in April. Big question: What has changed between then and now? Do you all of a sudden like Elon as a CEO? Are you just sad you missed out on gains? Take this a big learning experience. Write down your behaviour and strategies, and refer to this self-created documentation before you make any moves in the future. Take emotion out of the game, and tweak your strategy/document as you learn more.\n\nWhen TSLA hit $1000 in June, that\'s when I finally had the conviction to say: ""Fuck it, I\'m getting in"". I put 10% of my portfolio into TSLA and made a strategy for myself:\n\n1. I would hold TSLA long term so price fluctuations wouldn\'t scare me.\n\n2. I did research and fundamentally believed that TSLA could go to $2000 within 3 years based on their upcoming product lines (ie. insurance product, power plant, batter augments, robo-taxi, etc).\n\n3. I created a buying strategy that I would buy whenever the price dropped a certain amount, or if it crossed certain resistance levels. I also realized TSLA moves on momentum, so I would buy immediately the morning of any news release. That included earnings, stock split, battery day, etc. And that strategy has worked really well for me.\n\nUsing these rules of order, I stopped trying to buy into TSLA with emotion and rather focused on fundamentals and market forces.\n\nIf I was getting into TSLA today, I would use the following strategies:\n\n1. I would only go in with a small amount, no more than 5% of my account out of fear of over valuation.\n\n2. If I had funds to go in with 100 shares, I would buy 100 shares and immediately buy near term puts to hedge against a heavy downswing. So you could buy 100 shares at $640 and then buy $600 Jan 15 puts to hedge against a heavy downsize. That would bring you peace of mind against an ""overvaluation"".\n\nAfter that, you could decide to sell covered calls to bring down your cost average if TSLA stabilizes, or just let it ride if it keeps running.\n\n\nBe very aware that TSLA as a company is surging right now mainly because of supply/demand economics. All fundamentals went out the window after TSLA announced the split and the stock surged 100% since then.\n\nAlso, be aware that LOTS of stocks in the past few years have gone up 500%. You didn\'t just miss out on TSLA, here is a list of companies:\n\n1. AMZN\n\n2. MSFT\n\n3. AAPL\n\n4. PAYC\n\n5. OKTA\n\n6. AMD (which is actually up 50x...)\n\n7. NVDA\n\n8. SHOP\n\n9. APPS\n\n10.

The number of shares you have doesn\'t matter by itself, what matters is the amount of money you\'re investing. \n\nSay someone wants to sell a pie that is valued at $100. They can sell the whole pie, or cut it into halves and sell those for $50, or cut it into quarters and sell those for $25, or tenths for $10, etc.\n\nNow let\'s say you want to spend $50 on pie. It doesn\'t much matter if you\'re buying 5 slices at $10, or 2 slices at $25, or one big half at $50. The only obstacle to buying pie would be if you cannot afford the minimum price for a piece, which in our case would be the price of a single share.\n\nNow all that said, QQQJ and ARKK are also completely different things...look at top 10 holdings.

Cohen's involvement will make zero difference on the longterm value. Gamestop is a dying company. I've literally worked in the industry for 10 years. I've seen it transition from being a big player to falling apart at the seams. Good luck. You'll need it."", ""This isn't any different than always:\n\nBen Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.\n\nEven though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions, he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.\n\nMr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you.\n\nBut, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy.”\n\nBen’s Mr. Market allegory may seem out-of-date in today’s investment world, in which most professionals and academicians talk of efficient markets, dynamic hedging and betas. Their interest in such matters is understandable, since techniques shrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of investment advice. After all, what witch doctor has ever achieved fame and fortune by simply advising “Take two aspirins”?\n\nThe value of market esoterica to the consumer of investment advice is a different story. In my opinion, investment success will not be produced by arcane formulae, computer programs or signals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets. Rather an investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.\n\nFollowing Ben’s teachings, Charlie and I let our marketable equities tell us by their operating results – not by their daily, or even yearly, price quotations – whether our investments are successful. The market may ignore business success for a while, but eventually will confirm it. As Ben said: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.” The speed at which a business’s success is recognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the company’s intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate. In fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us the chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price."", ""If a large part of their target demo is low income people and kids that can't afford to shop anywhere else than that's an even bigger strike against them. \n\nThe question here isn't if Gamestop is a viable business. It certainly is. The question is if there is enough potential growth to invest in the company. If they can't grab the big money spenders away from the digital/big box retailers then it's not a worthwhile investment."", ""I did read. You said your prediction is the bulls win. Whether or not this is a short term play is irrelevant. The bulls aren't winning shit. This company is going down the tube fast. Y'all thinking that this DD is going to be a gamechanger over how much the consoles boosted the stock are crazy. Pandemic, consoles, and a dash of Cyberpunk are the only reasons Gamestop is at this valuation. And just like every other console release and stock surge, this will result in a fast crash down to the floor."", ""You are missing a large part of their target demographic: low income people and kids. They don't have good credit or a credit card to shop at Amazon. They trade in whatever they already have for shitty store credit or use Gamestop's new convenient rip off financing because that's the only way they can get the new console and the latest Madden."", ""Yes, but there are a number of stocks that have grown more than the S&amp;P 500 (like all the upper half of performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500). But, I am not going to invent in a single tech stock in '15 just because I want to out perform the S&amp;P 500. If something were to go wrong with that particular company I invested in then I could be up a creek and tech companies are not immune from contraction (Myspace, Vine, etc.). Diversified portfolios are key to long term growth. \n\nJust because one stock outperforms, potentially temporarily, the market does not mean that stock or market segment will continue to out perform the market.

Investors can feel the difference.\nBy Jason M. Thomas\nNov. 16, 2017 7:10 pm ET\nSHARE\nTEXT\n39\n\nPHOTO: ISTOCK/GETTY IMAGES\nThe media and the public pay a lot of attention to broad stock market indexes, but many of the most well-known measures aren’t what they seem. The Wilshire 5000, for example, contains roughly 3,500 companies. There haven’t been 5,000 domestic stocks to include in the index since 2005.\n\nThe number of public companies in the U.S. has been on a steady decline since peaking in the late 1990s. In 1996 there were 7,322 domestic companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Today there are only 3,671. Easy access to venture, growth and private-equity capital means that companies no longer need to pursue an initial public offering to fund growth or access liquidity. Increases in regulations, shareholder lawsuits and activist demands have also diminished the appeal of a public listing. Over the past two decades, the number of annual IPOs has fallen sharply, to 128 in 2016 from 845 in 1996.\n\nCompanies are going public later in their lifespans—if they ever do at all. The dearth of IPOs has led to a 50% increase in the average age of public companies, from 12 years in 1996 to 18 years in 2016. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in 1994, taking the company public three years later with an enterprise value of approximately $600 million. From 1997 to 2002 public investors enjoyed a 12-fold appreciation in Amazon’s stock. Conversely, Mark Zuckerberg waited until Facebook was eight years old before taking it public. At the time of Facebook’s IPO in 2012, the social-media company had a market value of more than $100 billion.\n\n\nThe trend away from IPOs has benefited private market players at the expense of everyday investors. With companies like Uber, Airbnb and other successful startups delaying their IPOs for so long, there is little prospect for public returns on a scale similar to those enjoyed by Amazon’s early stockholders. The aversion to public listings isn’t limited to the technology sector. Microcap, small-cap and midcap stocks have all but disappeared from U.S. exchanges. Over the past 20 years, the average size of a publicly listed company in the U.S. has risen nearly fourfold, after accounting for inflation.\n\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nOpinion: Morning Editorial Report\n\nAll the day's Opinion headlines.\n\nPREVIEW\nSUBSCRIBE\nWSJ NEWSLETTER\n\nNotes on the News\nThe news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.\nNotes on the News\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can unsubscribe at any time.I agree to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice.\nSIGN UP\nAs a large number of yesterday’s “growth stocks” have migrated to private portfolios, so too has the diversifying economic exposure they provide. The dispersion of stock returns—the average difference in monthly returns across all stocks—has declined as a result, narrowing the gap between the winners and losers. Less dispersion reduces the value of stock picking, and investors have responded accordingly. Since 2000, roughly $1.7 trillion has been invested using passive strategies like exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. At the same time, funds pursuing active strategies have experienced $1.4 trillion in outflows.\n\n\nSince ETFs and index funds buy stocks on a pro rata basis, ignoring price or fundamentals, the rise of passive investing has intensified the correlation of returns across stocks. Discretionary, research-based stock selection now accounts for only 10% of average trading volume. The offsetting deviations in company performance that were once the hallmark of a broadly diversified stock portfolio have been overwhelmed by marketwide buy or sell orders.\n\nEquity allocations are supposed to offer investors exposure to earnings growth and idiosyncratic business risk. Company-specific outperformance has become increasingly difficult to achieve in public markets dominated by mature businesses and passive fund flows. Today, it isn’t possible to assemble a portfolio with the same makeup as the stock market of 1997 without exposure to private markets.\n\nMany investors take this approach in emerging markets, where mega banks, mining, energy and telecommunications companies tend to account for a disproportionate share of available stocks. The limited pool of investment options in such countries means that market values tend to be highly correlated and fluctuate in response to fund flows rather than fundamentals. The greater the dissonance between the stock market and the real economy, the more investors must rely on various forms of private equity to gain exposure to the underrepresented but faster-growing industry segments and companies.\n\nThe stock market today isn’t the stock market of 20 years ago. Investors, take heed.\n\n\nCopied and pasted from the site, no edits made."", ""That would be cool and make sense if Gamestop didn't actually have significantly more institutional investor ownership by percentage compared to Tesla while only having a retail ownership percentage that is just a few points higher."", 'The masses are absolutely playing with pocket change.

Check the number of recalls in the past 30 days. Check model 3 issues all over reddit and youtube.\n\nTesla's percentage of recalls has been only slightly higher than that of the legacy automakers in 2019 and 2020, and that's because they have only 3 different models so each issue automatically affects a large portion of their fleet. They're also a young company, so they still have a lot less experience than their competitors. Perfecting manufacturing quality takes time.\n\n&gt; They could charge more, but who would buy it?\n\nIt's a simple matter of price and demand. We've seen during the pandemic that even with 30% fewer car sales globally, Tesla still sold every car they made, so they have least 30% more demand than supply. If they increase the prices, demand goes down but they could increase the prices quite a bit before demand goes down by 30%.\n\n&gt; Other EVs are cheaper than Tesla for similar range.\n\nOnly in the budget segment, which contains smaller cars that require way less kWh/kg.

Is it the most likely outcome? No. The stats are the stats.\n\nBut there are variables that you can control that increase your probability of success. For anyone involved in investing, you need to develop 2 real skills: 1) Stock selection and 2) Having a plan (esp for when a stock goes against you).\n\n1) stock selection is obvious. Take this seriously (reading someone else's DD is not taking it seriously), so start with what you know. my dad's a pharmacist - so i told him to start with pharma stocks. He can see what's coming to the market and have well informed opinions (makes him feel comfortable taking big swings). It's also a good way for him to understand valuation -&gt; he often asks, how much should Stock X go up? So we get into the exercise, well, how many people have condition X? Is this a chronic condition or a condition which has a short duration - from there you can figure out a reasonable revenue amount - make an estimate of margins -&gt; gets to how much new EPS/CashFlow is produced by this one drug. The move up in EPS/FCF should be at least (nothing is ever certain) the amount the stock goes up. \n\n2) if you have a plan/thesis, then you can make better decisions. Picking up the abv example - let's a say competing company announces a new drug aimed at the same patient segment, and Stock X goes down. So either the market is saying my Dad is wrong (very possible from my experience!) or he gets a golden opportunity to load up on the stock at a discount. bc he has a thesis, he can read the new announcement and see whether that breaks his thesis. In this case, my dad liked Stock X bc he liked the pharmalogical approach was superior to what others were doing in the market. So in this case, he had to check whether this new company took the same approach as the company (Stock X) - if so, he sells. If not, he buys.\n\nin my experience, if you ask most successful professional investors what investing principles matters, the answer they give is invariably is some form of this. can't stress that while your building up tool kit, start with what you know and then branch out to other areas (do your work to actually learn the space). For example, if you're in retail, you can probably can spot which companies have well-run stores and which ones are poorly run."", 'Good synergy with Slack.

Why not.  \n\nThe people that want to 'flex' aren't multimillionaires. They are new money kids that want to show they aren't middle class.  \n\nYou have to understand that companies purposefully try to capture certain market segments, and in Tesla's case, it's middle-upper class, as it is with Apple.  \n\nDefinitely not upper class. People with money don't waste it on frivolities just to flex. They use it to make more money through investments."", ""A 50% loss is pretty horrible, especially considering the opportunity cost when compared to a profitable opportuny missed because you ahd your funds locked up in GME.

The first criticism argues, explicitly or implicitly, that no adjustment should be\nmade for the difference in quality between an item that is\nno longer sold and its replacement. That position appears\nto be based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of the\nCPI, and it also is impractical, given the rapidly changing consumer marketplace. The second criticism is that,\nby expanding the use of hedonic quality adjustment over\nthe past 10 years, the BLS has imposed arbitrary estimates\nof the “pleasure” consumers derive from new products,\nseverely distorting the CPI as a result. This criticism is a \nfundamental misunderstanding of the hedonic method,\nand it ignores the fact that the introduction of all hedonic\nquality adjustments since 1999 has had only a very small\nimpact on the overall CPI.\n\n\n&gt;Americans will be understandably concerned if they\nare told that the BLS bases the CPI on subjective and exaggerated assumptions about product quality improvements. They also will be suspicious if told that the BLS\nmanipulates nonscientific models to estimate the value of\nquality change. On the contrary, in every aspect of CPI\nconstruction, the BLS goal is to use objective, rather than\nsubjective, methods wherever possible. As stated in a 1998\npaper coauthored by the Commissioner of the BLS,\n\n\n&gt;&gt;For the BLS, the primary task is...to employ the most\naccurate methods available for dealing with quality change and with new goods and outlets. Those\nmethods must be rigorous, objective and reproducible, minimizing the role of analyst judgment.26\n\n\n&gt;Why does the BLS adjust for quality change at all? Many\nof the challenges associated with producing a CPI arise because the number and types of goods and services found in the market are constantly changing. Over time, the goods\nand services in the CPI samples are being replaced by new\nproducts or by new models of existing products. Consequently, if the BLS tried to maintain a fixed and unchanging sample for the CPI, that sample would quickly shrink\nto the point where it became unrepresentative of what\nconsumers were purchasing. Each time an item in the CPI\nsample permanently disappears from the shelves, the BLS\nhas to choose another item and then has to make some\ndetermination about the relative qualities of the old and\nreplacement items. If it tried to avoid making such quality\ndeterminations and adjustments—for example, if it treated all new items as identical to those they replaced—significant upward or downward CPI biases would result. As\nstated in the international CPI manual published by the\nInternational Labor Office (ILO), “Statistical offices must\npay close attention to the treatment of quality change and\ntry to make explicit adjustments whenever possible.”27\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;To take the most straightforward example of quality\nadjustment, which the CPI handles automatically, suppose\nthe maker of a 1.5-ounce candy bar selling for 75 cents\nreplaces it by the same brand of candy bar, still selling for\n75 cents, but weighing only 1.0 ounce. If the shrunken\nsize is ignored, it looks like the price hasn’t changed. The\nCPI, however, prices candy and most other food items on\na per-ounce basis and would automatically record a 50-\npercent increase in the quality-adjusted price of the item,\nfrom 50 cents per ounce to 75 cents per ounce.\n\n\n&gt;Another example of how the need for quality adjustment arises is a hypothetical (but plausible) situation in\nwhich the CPI has been tracking the price of a specific\nmodel of 32-inch standard-definition color television at\na certain store. If the store no longer sells that model, the\nCPI data collector will find a replacement model to price\neach period thereafter. In the event that the store has decided to sell only high-definition televisions (HDTVs), one\nof those will necessarily be selected as the replacement. In\nthat case, the replacement television may cost 4 times the\nprice of the previous standard-definition model. It would\nbe unreasonable to treat this rise in price as a sudden fourfold increase in cost, given that the HDTV model has a\nlarger screen size, a higher resolution picture, and other\nenhanced features. The BLS must make some estimate of\nhow much of the price difference is due to the improved\nquality associated with the HDTV model.\n\n\n&gt;The BLS uses a number of methods for quality adjustment in the CPI, ranging from the simplest (for example,\nignore the difference in quality if the new and old items\nare sufficiently similar), to the indirect (assume that the\nquality-adjusted price change is the same as the average\nchange observed for other items in the sample), to the\ncomplex (for example, use manufacturers’ production cost\ninformation to adjust automobile prices each year when\nnew models are introduced).28 For a small number of CPI\ncomponents, the BLS employs hedonic regression models in dealing with product replacements. Each method\ncan and does lead to quality adjustments in either direction, because the new items in the sample can be of either\nhigher or lower quality than the products they replace, as\nthe aforementioned candy bar and television examples\ndemonstrate.\n\n/\n\n&gt;In fact, hedonic regression has nothing to do with\ncalculating or estimating the amount of pleasure a consumer receives by using an item. Actually, the term refers\nto the use of a statistical procedure called multiple regression analysis, in which the market valuation of a feature is\nestimated by comparing the prices of items with and without that feature. For example, the CPI hedonic analysis\nof television prices calculates, at a given point in time,\nthe percent difference in market prices associated with\nan additional inch of screen size. Then, if a television is\nreplaced by one with a larger screen, the CPI commodity analyst for televisions can adjust the observed price\ndifference by estimating what the old television would\nhave cost had it had the larger screen size. The process\nof estimating these market values is somewhat technical,\nand it can require a significant amount of work assembling and processing data on product prices and characteristics, but many of the dismissive reactions to the\nhedonic method probably are based on its name rather\nthan on an understanding of the actual process. The ILO’s\ninternational CPI manual states, “The hedonic approach\nto quality adjustment can provide a powerful, objective\nand scientific method of evaluating changes in quality\nfor certain kinds of products.”31', 'HFT can also mean hundreds or even thousands of microtrades (fractions of pennies) that occur in between what the common retail trader would see upon purchasing a stock at market price (with Robinhood, for example) and the time of its execution, and of course augmented with AI in recent times.

That means, that no matter how much money they are making on the upward cycle, unless they adapt the runway will eventually run out.', ""You assume that being above average and being stupid are mutually exclusive. Most people are stupid because they do a lot of things without doing the necessary thinking. I'm not talking about their intellectual capabilities but their decisions and actions.\n\nUnfortunately, I use to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they know what they're doing. So I assumed that prices accurately reflected all the knowledge available and that people know what to do with that knowledge. I've since come to realize that both are false, and it helped me tremendously.\n\nAs I said, I was an actuary, but not all actuaries know what they're doing. Some of them are quite stupid in their actions and decisions, even if they have above average IQ.\n\nSimilarly, I was a consultant at McKinsey (possibly exposing myself here) and counseled senior executives of F500 companies. Some of them were stupid, and some of my colleagues were stupid too, even though they're supposed to be the cream of the crop. I can't really assume anyone is competent these days and tend to evaluate people and situations on an individual basis. I'm fairly confident that most of the shorts in GME were lazy or constrained in their thinking, because I also blew off GME initially because of the price action, short interest, and Blockbuster comparison. But when I actually started researching it, it was clear as day that it was undervalued - it was obvious. But if you go in with an existing bias, you'll see what you want to see, or you won't even give it a chance."", ""Ahhh, i must've been missed the early GME threads. They're still pumping it right now though and its currently overvalued imo."", ""If you've ever read Thinking Fast and Slow, then you know that people are lazy thinkers, and would rather use superficial yet erroneous comparisons like Blockbuster rather than thinking from first principles and evaluating every opportunity independently. It appears that GME longs have done more DD than shorts. DDS is another case where if you go deep and consider its idiosyncrasies, it's clearly undervalued, but people would rather use heuristics which don't fit the situation because they either can't or won't do all the necessary thinking and research.\n\nThat, and most people are stupid."", ""GME had a lot of long-term shorts from $40 all the way down, and many did not cover in the single digits. For most of the year, GME has been priced for bankruptcy, but since they reached the new console cycle, the chance of bankruptcy in the next 2 years is zero.\n\nHave you ever looked at their 20 year chart and seen what happened in 2007 and 2013 with new consoles? Crazy cash flow and SP growing multi-fold. And 2020 is an even bigger console cycle than either 2007 or 2013. Most shorts only reference the last 5 years, but that's stupid when GME is cyclical and the cycles can last 7-8 years long.\n\nI got in at $5, when net cash was $5/share. That's net cash, not total cash, which was more than $10/share. I'm an actuary so I'm super risk averse, but even I realized GME was a low risk value play after looking at their balance sheet, cash flow, and historical performance.\n\nIt's still undervalued, and likely will be until Q4 and Q1 earnings, which will be the first to reflect the new console cycle.\n\nIf you followed WSB, you wouldn't have gotten into GME until $8 or even $12-13 because of all the negative sentiment, but I do give them credit for realizing a good play (I'm not talking about the MOMO/FOMO crowd)"", 'WSB started pumping GME when it was at $8.

Many manufacturers utilize Mobile-Eye (they make money on the integration) or have their own solution such as Argo AI for VW / Ford, GM Cruise for GM, etc\n\n* Making batteries - Tesla does not make batteries. They partner with battery makers and oftentimes just buy from cheap suppliers like they do in China and hence the China battery scandal. GM is also partnering with LG Chem. VW is doing joint partnerships too and already has 15 million cars worth of batteries locked up. BYD Auto is the largest battery maker already. GM has the ultium battery that is comparable to Teslas ""secret sauce"". VW with it\'s investment in Quantum Scape has next generation battery. Toyota is the only one with Solid State batteries will make a limited test vehicle in 2021. There is no Tesla battery secret sauce.\n\n* Powerwall, etc - Again, each company already has or is entering this space. For example, BYD B-Box by BYD Auto. Or just the equivalents from the actual battery makers (LG Chem, Panasonic Smart, Fortress Power, etc).\n\n* Solar - yes, this is the one Tesla component that is not found in other car makers. This was a failing business that was taken over from his cousin (nepotism) and was a really shady business deal. The business segment has poor YoY growth (which is why he had to save his cousin\'s biz with a merger) and it is highly competitive.

There’s literally been hundreds of bull dd posts about gme in the past month alone.', 'Justin Dopierala on the site which will not be named posted this today “It is a cycle. New game sales track new console sales. Most people buy 2-5 new games shortly after they purchase a new console. Over time the average gamer buys less games each year. The new console cycle has barely started. GameStop growing same store sales 16.5% with only half a month worth of inventory is not alarming. I understand that the growth is lower from a total revenue standpoint, but that is a silly number to look at. Sales are up on a materially lower store footprint.\nI think the holiday sales number may actually surprise a lot of people. YOY 2018 to 2019 - November was much stronger than December.\nManagement specifically noted at the time ""We expected a challenging sales environment for the holiday season as our customers continue to delay purchases ahead of anticipated console launches in late 2020. However, the accelerated decline in new hardware and software sales coming out of black Friday and throughout the month of December was well below our expectations, reflective of overall industry trends.""\nDecember of 2019 was awful. Clearly there are still supply constraints that are depressing what the numbers could be if those supply constraints did not exist, but that is only serving to push the revenue further out into the future. From what I could see during December, there was a lot of game purchases going on, more than I can ever remember seeing. As just one example, I ordered a PS5, have not received it yet, but I purchased 6 new PS4/PS5 games from GameStop so that I could wrap them for my children to open. It is very possible that even if revenue does not blow us away that software sales may be exceeding expectations. I suspect that giving video games as gifts was at the top of the list this holiday season. People always seem to forget that aspect of GameStop. Sure, you can download games digitally, but GameStop will always do well during the holiday season when people want to gift and wrap a physical item.\nBeyond that, you\'re right, GameStop needs to transform. They are starting to do that with the revenue sharing agreements and the exclusive partnerships and expanding into the PC market.\nIf you exclude 2019 for a moment, the revenue is basically flat over almost a significant length of time once you take out the segments that they have sold (i.e. Spring Mobile).\nThat aside, as a long-term bull, my thesis has never been about revenue. That is why I rarely try to make bold predictions on revenue figures as some authors have. There is a reason why accurate revenue predictions have had zero relevance to the performance of the stock. GameStop has numerous levers available to improve profitability. I have highlighted these many times over the last two years.\nManagement has only taken advantage of a few of the levers and they did so lackadaisically. Stores should have been shut down much more aggressively. International should have been sold. The sale leasebacks should have been done a year earlier. The debt should have been refinanced in early 2019 and they would have avoided the high interest rate that COVID forced. They repurchased shares, but did so in the most illogical way possible (Dutch Auction). They moved to 1 employee in the box only after COVID shut the stores down (they could have done this a year earlier). Management and the BOD has made poor decision after poor decision after poor decision. While their are things that are improving (store layout / website / app / customer data partnerships / revenue sharing) this team missed a lot of layups that could have added hundreds of millions to the bottom-line if executed when I laid it all out for them.\nThe bottom-line is that I am more interested in growing profitability than growing revenue. They have the levers to do both and they have finally started to meaningfully take care of the bloated SG&amp;A. As revenue naturally comes back due to the console refresh we should finally start seeing the fruits of this labor as the SG&amp;A reductions are mostly fixed and not variable. This means that as revenue grows, SG&amp;A will not grow nearly as fast as most of the cost is fixed and not a function of lower or higher revenue. This is the most important piece that many of the GameStop bears can not comprehend right now. Look at how well GameStop has performed the last couple of quarters with same store sales growth of what.... -20%? -30%? Now that same store sales growth is 16.5% probably moving to at least 20%+ the market will finally be able to see how quickly profit ramps up on a slimmed down footprint and more tightly managed SG&amp;A line-item.\nA lot of people are focused on revenue and gross margin. I am focused on net margin. This is where GameStop is set to shine and blow away the market.\nYou are right though @Cyan007 - GameStop needs a visionary leading the BOD that will allocate the upcoming massive cash flows towards expanding profitable revenue growth. It is entirely possible and that is what will decide GameStop\'s future 5 to 10 years from now.\nIn regards to the next 2-3 years though - Wall Street just doesn\'t understand what is about to hit them when a company that makes material permanent SG&amp;A cuts suddenly grows revenue 20%+.”', 'Gamestop for 20 bucks?

Oh dear...', 'I like Procter and Gamble. Their products are well known brands which almost everyone uses in a way or another. I prefer P&amp;G because they are the biggest operator in the household &amp; personal products sector. They’ve been able to up their dividends consistantly for a long time. Their payout-ratio is pretty good, about 60% of their income goes to dividend payouts. Their revenue has been a little weird the past years, since there’s been a few dips over the past 10 years or so, but I wouldn’t be that worried. They are crisis proof, since everyone still has to use the basic household products whatever the time and P&amp;G happens to have the best and most known products in many areas.\n\nApple is great. I’d recommend them as a dividend growth company. Payout-ratio is small, only 25%. They are expanding so well and I don’t think the EV news are fully in the price even though the price had a decent rise, since Apple’s entry to the EV market is a new thing and there isn’t much info on the topic other than the launch is expected in 2024. I’m eager to see what will happen and how popular the cars will be. As we get more info on this, the price will grow even more and at some point the EV segment will be priced in better, but this is just my humble opinion.\n\nVisa is basically the middle man in the buying process between the customer’s bank and the merchant’s bank. They get their money by doing the process safely and quickly between the banks. They get even more money when the process is done abroad. For example, the merchants bank is in England and the customer’s bank is in the US. Visa takes bigger transaction payments when the banks aren’t from the same country.\n\nAnd about Tesla. Tesla isn’t going to give dividends any time soon. They are still growing and opening factories, so dividend paying isn’t there number one thing at the moment. Tesla is also very volatile so keep that in mind.

Over the years, as their brands shifted from Direct-to-Retail licenses to Wholesale, they were able to reduce the book value of these brands for tax purposes. To give you an idea, this year they sold only the Chinese segment of a brand, Umbro, for 62.5 mil, the Chinese segment of Starter for 16 mil, 10% of the Chinese stake in Danskin for 1.6 mil. Managing China was very difficult for them, and this was a great move. Most of these Chinese segments were not even generating revenue at the time of sale. Meanwhile, the majority of the revenue of these brands are coming from Europe and North America. This has proven that Umbro is easily worth 400-500 mil, Starter and Danskin 100 mil each. Then they have 25 other brands. They have close to 100 mil cash on hand, and about 500 mil debt. Do the math, and you will see this company should be worth several hundred million dollars. Its market cap is less than 15 mil now, because of their enormous debt collecting interest at more than 10%. As they improved their balance sheet this year, they can either refinance that debt, or sell the whole company.

For context, I am a commercial underwriter. /u/mahorwitz  is correct that CRE needs to looked at as sectors and not one lump category since it contains so many different property types. My biggest concern lies with the Retail and Office segments of CRE. A lot of companies will be reducing their in-person staffing, either because of layoffs or because they have not noticed a significant decline in productivity from COVID. Retail is a concern since many people were forced in to utilizing online stores for product fulfillment and have noted the convenience aspect of it and will reduce their retail purchases in the immediate future.\n\n&gt; I have seen a huge increase in commercial property sales and at prices that don't make a whole lot of sense to me. We have had some borrowers sell their properties recently and most of them were unsolicited offers at prices well above what the market would typically dictate. On the flip side, we have had brokers reaching out to us to provide financing on some properties and they are looking for amounts above the LTV rates that we would even consider or the broker is pricing the property well above what it is worth according to our underwriting practices. The only reason that I can think of that is pushing more people in to commercial real estate is that it typically provides a steady stream of income from anywhere between 5% to 7% of the cost of the property. Obviously there are many variables that can cause owners to make less or even lose money but the 5 to 7% is pretty common. This percentage may seem more attractive and/or stable than what the stock market could provide. Also, with the exception of rare occurrences (COVID / economic downturns /etc.), commercial property prices are relatively stable.\n\n&gt; I'm honestly not too sure about what the future of the commercial market looks like. It's a really weird situation where it seems like things are normal on the surface but I keep seeing things on the back end that concern me a bit. I just don't know how wide spread that is and whether or not what I am seeing is common or just anecdotal. I still have my doubts about anything retail related, especially retail strip centers. If there is any downturn in the commercial market, I think that the multi-family sector will see the smallest impact and it will be the first to recover. My only concern with multi-family is that some of the asking rates for apartment units in our area (Phoenix, AZ) has increased exponentially over the years to the point that I think is unsustainable."", ""Fair to say it can be considered undervalued given the right circumstances fall into place for Cohen's side to get their way; I understand that.
