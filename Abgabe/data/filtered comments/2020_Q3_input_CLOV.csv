2020-07-07,"[""I've been watching lightspeed for over 10 years, they have one of the best POS on the market. I remember when they had you install the light speed server to use their program than they purchased some web pos and integrated. There pricing is very expensive compared to Reddit favorites but it's as the name says lighting quick compared to most of the cloud-based pos. \n\nShopify pos offering is subpar at best, and square retail just got better recently but still not close to lightspeed. I don't think anyone would buy lightspeed out because Shopify could easily recreate it if they actually spent money on their pos. Combined with their eCommerce cart it would easily win the in-store pos but for some reason, they refuse to go all in. Just as square refuses to go all-in on their cart. \n\nThey mainly compete with vend, clover, toast but not as specialized in food. \n\nI put in a limit order @ 18 in May and my brokerage screwed me and it shot up day after and I refused to chase it.\n\nGreat company I can see it going to $50 easy, but I don't see tremendous growth."", 'The Dairy Queen‚Äôs are all using clover. Seemed to work well for me', 'Our neighbor has one, I use it every time I get coffee, I found it was really bad. Bad interface, weird design, slow. Not nearly as good as our square. Not to say clover is bad, but that was just my experience.\n\nedit: They have the clover mini it looks like, which is $750. crazy to me', 'I‚Äôve seen clover registers/card machines more and more at business though']"

I have been suffering from this  (HERPES) for the past 3 years now, I had spent a lot of money going from one places to another, from hospitals for treatment,i have been my home every day applying ACYCLOVIR to reduce the outbreak. Constant checks up have been my hobby not until this faithful day, I was searching through the internet, I saw a testimony on how Dr DOHGO helped someone in curing his HERPES disease, quickly I copied his email which is [doctordohgo@gmail.com](mailto:doctordohgo@gmail.com) just to give him a test I spoke to him, he asked me to do some certain things which I did, he told me that he is going to provide the herbal cure to me, which he did, then he asked me to go for medical checkup after some days after using the herbal cure, behold I was cured within 21days of usage, he only asked me to post the testimony through the whole world, faithfully am doing it now, please brothers and sisters, he is great, I owe him in return. If you are having a similar problem just email him on ( [doctordohgo@gmail.com](mailto:doctordohgo@gmail.com) ) or you can whatsApp his mobile number on +2347062142293\n\nhe also have remedy for the following;\n\nALS\n\nCANCER\n\nDIABETES\n\nHIV\n\nHPV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReply']"

2020-08-03,"[""What I'm about about to say is going to bring out a lot of hate but it's the truth.  I love SQ, love Jack, love $arkk but sometimes the truth hurts... \n\nI'm starting to get really bearish on SQ I think they are going to actually miss on earning and you will see that that the velocity of cash app is really down.  Not how many broke teens have downloaded Cashapp, but how much money is actually circulating in the ecosystem. \n\nOn top of this all the mom &amp; pop retail outlets are crushed, there are fighting competition on all sides.  SQ was ubiquitous at many urban eateries but lately most seem to be using clover terminals.\n\nHard to justify buying shares at $130 when the company is almost trading at a P/E of 300.  Jim Mckelvey likes to brag about how they beat amazon but he's wrong if he things there isn't real competition on the horizon. Geopolitical headwinds will increasingly make it difficult for a banking app to have global reach, that needs to be factored into evaluations. \n\nTo recap I like SQ, very innovative company with a good culture, however it is way overpriced and lookout for the earnings share price drop ;)""]"

2020-08-30,"['I could talk your ear off about Square. I bought in towards the very beginning (around $10 a share), and have been consistently taking gains out along it\'s hyperbolic take-off.\n\nFor most of Square\'s publicly traded time, their payment receptacles at businesses were their big ""revolutionary"" product. Their biggest competitor to these products was ""Clover"" with company ""First Data"" (stock ticker FDC).\n\nIf I believe in a product, I often times research competitors &amp; invest a portion into the competitors as well. This was the case with Clover &amp; FDC.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall: FISV wanted a piece of the payment receptacle money as well, and ended up merging with FDC. This is why I own FISV stock instead of FDC stock now.\n\nSquare has since also developed their Cash App, and is raking in a lot from their CryptoCurrency purchases. Something crazy, like $300M profit, from last quarter alone. I can only imagine what CoinBase is making... but I digress.\n\nFISV is a long-established financial institution, and their acquisition of FDC definitely won some of my respect. After researching FISV (before the merger), I learned enough about their company to justify holding the stock, and I\'m glad I did. I\'m up about 30% since the merger occurred, but that is on top of all the gains I received from FDC. Gotta love compounding interest!\n\nAll of that having been said, I expect for FISV to continue to make substantial gains over the years, but not as fast as FDC was... since FDC is essentially only a piece of their portfolio now. \n\nHope that helps, and best of luck to you!']"
