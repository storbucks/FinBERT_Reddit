2020-09-13,"[""Trees already on the land where I own now. Depends on your goal, I do individual tree harvesting and planting. Cutting only what I need personally for milling. Then I replant these small sections, 150ft×30ft each year with whatever species I want there and I always leave some of the big mature trees. Think, park like with seeded clover trails and seedling apples, mullberry, white oaks, black cherry and walnuts when I'm done.   My neighbor to the south does select cuts, everything not oak natural regrowth. So his land is criss crossed with trails made by excavators and has tons of small random species trees. A year or two later those trails make great hunting too. The guy to the NW only cuts firewood. Some of them cut no trees at all and only take blow downs. Some just buy and hold it, are never there personally land just slowly increasing in value. \n\nUnless you have a ton of land or do smaller scale cutting. Tree harvests are money every 15yrs or so. Hunting leases are every year. Some people lease individual seasons so they get 3-4 payments a year. Land appreciation is only realized when you sell but that's should be a goal. If you cut all the trees at once the land value and ease of sale goes to shit. You can lease almost any type of land to hunters here, what is poor deer and bear hunting is good game bird hunting. Turkey hunting leases are becoming a big thing here in the last 10yrs, 80 acres will lease for $3k-5k a year just for deer season. $1-2k for birds, turkey has a spring and fall season. A site that's 75% field and 25% woods still bring almost top dollar leased to hunters.""]"
